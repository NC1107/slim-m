"""The client app's own copy of the notification sounds must stay byte-
identical to the canonical set this directory generates.

It is a copy rather than a symlink (see `client/packages/app/pubspec.yaml`'s
own comment on the assets entry, and `docs/os_backlog/windows_backlog.md`):
a git symlink checks out as a small text file naming its target on a Windows
clone without `core.symlinks` set, which Flutter then bundles as a garbage
"sound" rather than refusing to build. A plain committed copy has no such
failure mode on any platform, and this test is what keeps it from silently
drifting away from the canonical source `generate.py` writes.

Run with: python3 -m unittest discover -s assets/audio
