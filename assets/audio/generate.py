"""Regenerate every notification WAV from source.

The WAVs are committed and CI runs this and diffs, so a sound that drifts from
the code that claims to make it fails the build. Run it after touching either
synth.py or sounds.py:

    python3 assets/audio/generate.py

Prints what each sound measured, because the numbers are the reason to trust
that the family is level with itself.
