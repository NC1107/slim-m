# Only what is dlopen'd, so rpm's ELF scan cannot see it. libwebrtc opens its
# audio and screencast backends by soname, and libepoxy opens GL the same way.

# media_kit_video's own Linux plugin - the video texture/rendering
# integration, distinct from media_kit's separate dlopen of libmpv to drive
# playback - links libmpv and libepoxy directly (`pkg_check_modules` plus
# `target_link_libraries` in its own linux/CMakeLists.txt; confirmed with
# readelf on the built .so, which lists both as real NEEDED entries). rpm's
# own ELF scan should already pick these up automatically the way it does
# for GTK and GStreamer, but they are named explicitly as a fallback, and
# because a plain mpv-libs install (no -devel) ships only the versioned
# `libmpv.so.2`, never the unversioned name upstream's own install docs quote.
Requires:       libmpv.so.2()(64bit)
Requires:       libepoxy.so.0()(64bit)

%description
The slim-m desktop client: text channels, voice, screen share and direct
messages against a slim-m home server, either one you run yourself or one
you were invited to. One deployment is one community.

This package repackages the official Linux release rather than building from
source. The Flutter engine, the WebRTC library and the app's plugins ship
inside it, the way upstream builds them; GTK, audio, graphics and the secret
service come from the system.
