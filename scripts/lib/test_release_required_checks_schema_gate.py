"""The additive-only schema gate must actually be able to appear on the
commit `verify-release-checks.yml` verifies, not just be named in
`required_checks`.

`breaking-change-gate` (schema-ci) is pull_request-only by construction -
diffing needs a PR's base and head, which a bare push does not have - so it
can never carry a check-run on a release commit: a squash-merge mints a new
SHA the PR-time run was never attached to, and a release-please commit never
touches `schema/**` at all. Naming that job in `required_checks` would make
every release time out waiting for a check-run that structurally cannot
exist there.

This is a shape a passing test cannot see by running anything - GitHub
Actions triggers and `if:` conditions are configuration, not code - so it is
checked the way `route_reachability_test.dart` and `tests/canvas_index.rs`
check their own structural properties: by reading the real workflow files
rather than a copy of their intent.

Parsed as text rather than through PyYAML on purpose. The hygiene job runs
`python3 -m unittest` against a bare runner with no pip install step, and
every sibling test in this directory is importable there; a third-party
import here would fail in CI while passing on any machine that happens to
have the module.

    `ReleaseRequiredChecksSchemaGateTest` pins one job by name because that one
    caused an incident. Every other entry in `required_checks` got only the
    weaker "this name is some job's name" test, so a required check quietly
    becoming pull-request-only, or losing `main` from its push branches, would
    not be caught until it timed a release out seventy minutes in.

    Deliberately not asserting the absence of a push `paths:` filter, which is
    what a first reading of the schema-ci incident suggests. Six of these checks
    legitimately carry one - `server-ci` on `crates/**`, `client-ci` and
    `client-ios-ci` on `client/**` - and a release-please commit does touch
    those. Inferring whether a given filter matches a given component's release
    commit means modelling what release-please writes, and a gate that models
    that wrongly is worse than no gate. schema-ci was the case where the filter
    genuinely could not match, and it is pinned by name below.
