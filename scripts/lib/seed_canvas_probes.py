"""Deliberate edge-case probes against a channel's canvas surface.

This is the "integration test in disguise" half of canvas seeding: each
probe names an expected response and records whether the server actually
gave it, so a run's report can distinguish a documented ceiling working as
designed from something that broke, is awkward, or is missing entirely.
Nothing here is fatal - an unexpected answer is recorded as a finding, not
an exception, so one surprising probe does not abort the rest of the run.
