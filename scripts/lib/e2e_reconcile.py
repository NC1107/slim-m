"""An edit and a delete that happen while one client is away.

This is the one thing the message op stream exists for, and the only scenario
in the harness where a client is deliberately not watching. Every other
scenario keeps both clients open, which is exactly why none of them could have
caught the debt this closes: with both sockets live, an edit arrives as a
frame and the local copy is corrected without any cursor being consulted.

The client goes away by navigating to a blank page rather than being killed,
so its browser profile and drift's IndexedDB survive. That is deliberate: the
local cache and its cursors have to still be there, holding the old text, for
the return trip to have anything to correct.
