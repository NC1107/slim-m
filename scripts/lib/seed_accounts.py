"""Registers the seed accounts and the day's channel.

Reuses `e2e_api.Api` for every call rather than a second HTTP client, and
follows `e2e_seed.py`'s own pattern of a first-account-claims-a-fresh-
deployment flow - extended here to also work against an already-claimed one,
via an admin login that mints an invite and creates the channel itself.

Repeat runs reuse the same accounts by default rather than minting a fresh
cohort: `seed-data.py` now defaults `--username-tag` to empty and the
password to a value cached per deployment (`seed_credentials.py`), so a
persona's username is stable across runs and `register_accounts` logs into
it instead of re-registering the moment it already exists.
