"""A client-generated UUIDv7 id, matching what a real slim-m client sends.

CLAUDE.md's own architecture summary says identity is "a client-generatable
UUIDv7", and the server's `Id` newtype is UUIDv7 - but these scripts had
been minting plain, timestamp-free `uuid.uuid4()` ids for every seeded
message. The server accepts either (ordering comes from the per-channel
`seq` column, never the id), so nothing broke, but the point of a realism
script is to look like real traffic, and a real client never sends this.

Python's stdlib grew `uuid.uuid7()` in 3.14, the version CI pins here, so
this prefers that where it exists and only falls back to a hand-rolled
RFC 9562 layout - a 48-bit big-endian millisecond timestamp, a version
nibble of 7, the RFC 4122 variant bits, and a random remainder - for a
contributor running these scripts under an older interpreter.
