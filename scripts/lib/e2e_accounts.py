"""Account-level behaviour: usernames ignoring case, and the push preview.

The preview scenario is API-only on purpose. The switch is reachable on iOS
alone (`notification_settings_rows.dart` hides it everywhere else), so a web
browser has no control to drive; what is worth checking is the part the move to
an account setting changed, that a second device inherits the choice.
