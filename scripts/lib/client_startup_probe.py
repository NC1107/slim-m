"""Cold-start time and idle memory of the Flutter web client, over CDP.

There is no offscreen way to run the Linux desktop build on this box: the
Linux target links GTK, GTK needs a display connection to construct a
window, and this host has neither `Xvfb` installed nor passwordless `sudo`
to install it (checked, not assumed). So this measures the client's web
build instead, driven the same way `scripts/e2e.sh` already drives it: a
real headless `google-chrome-stable` process, addressed over the Chrome
DevTools Protocol on its `--remote-debugging-port`. Headless Chrome opens no
window on this or any display, which is what makes it a legitimate stand-in
for "no visible window on this box" rather than a workaround for it.

This is a real substitution, not the same measurement under another name.
"Cold start" here is dart2js-compiled JS plus CanvasKit/Skia WASM booting
inside V8, not the Linux GTK embedder's own native startup path, and "idle
memory" is a browser tab's resident memory (JS heap plus the WASM linear
memory backing Skia) rather than a native process's RSS. Both are read
honestly as what they are in the report this feeds, not represented as the
Linux desktop numbers the roadmap's own budget was written against.

Each measurement takes two readings, one against the app and one against
`about:blank` under the identical Chrome flags, so the app's own cost can be
told apart from headless Chrome's fixed per-process overhead the way the
Space analytics section of CLAUDE.md already found necessary for a server
control.
