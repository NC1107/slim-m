"""A job carrying any `if:` loses GitHub's implicit "every need succeeded" gate.
That has shipped a real bug twice: `server-image-merge` could push a
single-arch image to `:latest` after one architecture failed, and
`server-release-assets` could publish a partial release the same way. Both
were fixed by naming the producing job's `.result` in the condition, and
`docs/ci.md` records the incident.

`copr` was the third instance, found by an audit on 2026-09-21: it consumed
`linux-client`'s tarball with an `if:` that never mentioned it. It degraded
quietly rather than shipping something wrong - both COPR scripts run
`set -uo pipefail` without `-e`, so a missing tarball became a `::warning::`
and an exit 0 - which is exactly why nobody noticed for as long as they did.

This pins the pairs by name rather than inferring "consumes an artifact",
which cannot be read off the YAML. A blanket "every need appears in the `if:`"
rule was tried and rejected: nine jobs legitimately omit `release-please`,
because the gate reaches them through `verify-server-ci` / `verify-client-ci`,
which do check it. A gate with nine false positives teaches people to ignore
it. Add a pair here when a new job starts depending on another job's output.
