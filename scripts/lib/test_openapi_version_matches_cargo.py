"""schema/openapi.yaml's `info.version` must track the server's own version.

Nothing generates this field or checks it against anything else: redocly
lint only validates that it is a string, and the openapi-vs-router contract
test in crates/slimm-server/tests/openapi_contract.rs compares routes, never
this value. That let it sit at 0.18.5 against a 0.37.0 server until PR #596
hand-corrected it to 0.37.0 - and with nothing to hold the correction in
place, it drifted straight back: by the time this test was added the server
had moved on to 0.45.2 while this field still read 0.37.0.

The server's own Cargo.toml is the natural source of truth (`crates/slimm-server`
is what schema/openapi.yaml documents), so this ties the field to that rather
than to the client's pubspec.yaml, which versions a different artifact on its
own release cadence.
