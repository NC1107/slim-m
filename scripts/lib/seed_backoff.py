"""Retrying a write past a 429, without crashing the run or losing the action.

`Class::Write` (crates/slimm-server/src/ratelimit.rs) is a 30-request burst
refilling at 5/s, keyed per authenticated user. Ten accounts acting in
parallel each have their own bucket, but a single account moving fast enough
- a burst of consecutive messages, say - can still outrun its own refill.
The answer is jittered exponential backoff on the caller's side, not a
smaller burst on the server's: a 429 here is expected traffic shaping, not a
failure worth aborting the run over.
