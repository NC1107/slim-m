"""The client's typing refresh must stay inside the server's typing TTL.

`DEFAULT_TTL` in `crates/slimm-server/src/typing.rs` is how long a typing
state survives without a refresh. `_serverTypingTtlSeconds` in
`client/packages/app/lib/src/providers/typing_controller.dart` mirrors it by
hand, and the client's `_refreshEvery` is derived from that mirror at compile
time so there is one number to change on the Dart side.

The mirror itself has no mechanical link back to the Rust constant, which is
what this checks. Lower `DEFAULT_TTL` to reduce lock pressure without reading
one Dart doc comment and every user's typing indicator starts flickering off
mid-sentence - a symptom nobody would attribute to a server-side constant, on
a surface no test renders over time.

Same shape as `test_launch_screen_color_drift.py`, which guards the other
hand-copied cross-language constant in this repository, and a text parse
rather than a real one for the reason that file gives: the hygiene job runs
this suite on a bare runner with no pip install step.
