"""A final pass of activity on the newest slice of the channel.

The main loop's recency bias (`seed_state.RECENCY_BIAS`) already favours
recent targets over old ones, but that alone cannot fix a run's very last
messages: by the time they exist, there is almost no run left in which
anything could react to or reply on them. No weighting closes a shortage of
remaining actions. This runs once, after every worker has finished, against
a fixed snapshot of the newest messages and threads - never the whole
channel, or it would just move the same problem rather than fix the tail.

Two shapes this pass guarantees rather than leaves to chance, both real
defects reported against an earlier version of this script: a message can
carry several *different* emoji, and an emoji can be reacted to by several
*different* people (a count above 1) - see `_reaction_plan`. And a thread
can be freshly opened here, not just kept alive if one already exists near
the tail - see `SETTLE_NEW_THREADS` - with enough replies (3 to 8) to read
as an actual side conversation rather than a single, lonely reply.

A third shape: the newest polls also get a guaranteed round of votes, for
the same reason as the two above - a poll sent near the tail has almost no
run left in which `vote_poll`'s organic draws could reach it. See
`_poll_vote_plan` for why the spread is a weighted draw rather than one
vote per option: a poll where every option ties reads as generated, not as
something people actually answered.
