"""What a person reaches by holding or right-clicking: who reacted, and the
message menu with its quick reactions and its More page.

Both are driven with real pointer input (see e2e_input.py), which is the only
way to reach them: neither has a label to activate. An earlier note in
docs/e2e.md said a synthetic pointer event cannot open the message menu while
the accessibility tree is on. That holds for a click dispatched at a semantics
element, and does not for a genuine browser event sent with the semantics layer
lifted, which is what these use.

The reactions are added through the API so the scenario starts from a known
tally; the part under test, reading and acting on it, is all UI.
