"""Orchestrates a seeding run end to end.

Guards the target, sets up accounts and a channel, then lets every account
act in parallel (one thread each, one `Api`, one rate-limit bucket) until
each has spent its turn budget. Nothing here fabricates a timestamp: the
server stamps every write with its own clock, so a run cannot backdate
messages into earlier days to force a day-divider - see the module doc on
`seed-data.py` for what that means for a single run's history.

Any generated conversations split between two halves (`_split_conversation_
tail`): most run concurrently with the per-account utility workers, sharing
one pool so the two interleave in real time rather than reading as all
business first and all conversation second; a reserved tail then replays
strictly afterward, so the messages settle's own append lands after are
guaranteed conversation rather than left to whichever concurrent task
happened to still be posting when the interleaved phase ended - measured
against a real run, that race left the true newest messages mostly filler
regardless of how much conversation volume existed.
