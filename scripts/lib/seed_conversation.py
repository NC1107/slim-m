"""A generated conversation, parsed defensively before anything sends it.

`seed_ollama.load_or_generate_conversations` asks a model for a handful of
whole, structured multi-speaker conversations rather than a pool of
disconnected lines - see that module's own doc comment for why. This module
is what turns the model's raw JSON into something worth sending: `parse_
conversation` validates and coerces it, since an 8B model gets indices,
booleans and names wrong often enough that "validate, don't trust" is the
load-bearing property here. `seed_replay.replay` is the other half, split
into its own file to keep this one under the review budget - it sends the
validated result as real messages, threads and reactions.

A malformed or unusable conversation is dropped (`build_conversations`
catches and logs it) rather than raised, the same never-crash contract
`seed_ollama.py` already holds - a bad conversation just means fewer of
them, never a failed run.

`_pick_requests` sizes the whole batch to carry the run rather than
garnish it: an earlier version asked for a fixed handful of conversations
regardless of run size, which read as a rounding error against a large
run's own static filler - the newest slice of the channel, the only part
anyone actually reads, came out almost entirely one-liners. Turns are now
generated at `CONVERSATION_TURNS_PER_DRAW` per draw the utility loop would
otherwise spend, past 1:1 so conversation still dominates regardless of how
big `--accounts`/`--actions-per-account` make the run.

That ratio was 1.5 and is 1.0 now, deliberately trimmed: `seed_actions.
ACTIONS`'s own weights put about 77% of an ordinary draw on something
`CONVERSATION_COVERED` already lists as chat-shaped, so a 1:1 ratio still
generates noticeably more turns than that 77% share would have produced as
plain messages, without also generating half again as many on top of it.
Cost is not free the way the module doc used to claim: `seed_ollama.py`'s
cache makes a *repeat* run under the same `--seed` free, but the first,
uncached run of a few dozen conversations is real wall-clock time (measured
at roughly 0.7-1s per turn on this project's own dev GPU), all of it spent
before `seed_run.py`'s worker pool even starts. Trimming the ratio to 1.0
cuts that wait by a third against the old 1.5 for the same run size,
without giving up the "conversation dominates" property this exists for.
