"""An administrator giving another member a space-local name.

Driven from the member card, the way an administrator does it: the member list
row, Moderate, Rename. The nickname is then read where other people meet it,
the transcript's author line and the member list, and the account's own name is
checked to be untouched. It is removed at the end so every later scenario still
finds the member under the name the rest of the run uses.
