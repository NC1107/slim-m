"""Drives `scripts/report-advisory-issue.sh` against a fake `gh`.

A fake on PATH rather than a dry-run flag, deliberately: a dry run would only
prove that a status string reaches the right branch, where the thing actually
worth guarding is which `gh` subcommand each branch invokes - that an already
open issue is left alone rather than duplicated every day, and that a clean
scan closes one rather than silently leaving it open forever.

The fake records its own argv, so an assertion reads what the script really
did instead of what it printed about itself.
