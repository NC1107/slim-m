"""The endpoints a person reaches through UI this harness cannot drive yet.

Search, pins, polls, editing, deleting, invites, DMs, devices and read state
all have screens, but driving each of them would be a scenario apiece, and a
route with no coverage at all is worse than one covered a layer down. These
call the API directly and check the effect rather than the status code, so a
route that answers 200 and stores nothing still fails.

Each is named in the output, so the run says which routes it actually touched
rather than implying the whole schema was exercised.
