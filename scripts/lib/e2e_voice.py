    it with no audio getting through at all - an ICE path that failed over to
    nothing, a codec both ends refused, a capture device producing silence.

    Chrome runs with `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`, which generates a
    real tone rather than silence, so asserting the speaking indicator lights
    exercises the whole chain: capture, encode, the SFU, decode, LiveKit's own
    voice-activity detection, and that state reaching the roster.

    Each client is asked about the *other* one, which is the load-bearing part.
    A participant's own speaking state is computed from its own local audio
    level and would light with the network unplugged; only the remote one
    proves media crossed the room. A generous timeout because voice-activity
    detection needs a moment of audio before it reports anything.

    Reading a failure here: `join_call` runs immediately before and has already
    asserted both participants are ACTIVE at the SFU with unmuted microphone
    tracks. So a failure at this step is not "the call broke" - it is tracks
    present and no audio detected across them, which is either media genuinely
    not flowing or LiveKit's voice-activity detection never firing on Chrome's
    synthetic tone. The client half is not a suspect: the speaking threshold
    passes any level at the default sensitivity, so this reduces to whatever
    the SFU reports.

    Cutting it with `Network.emulateNetworkConditions` rather than a reload is
    the whole point - a reload leaves the call, so it would prove the rejoin
