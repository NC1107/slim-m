"""Starting a DM from the member list, then holding a call inside it.

There is no "+" affordance on the DM rail section (deliberately not built,
per CLAUDE.md); the only way to start a fresh DM is "Message" on a member's
own profile popover, reached from the member pane. Once the DM exists, a
call inside it is the same `VoiceScreen` a real voice channel uses (PR #306),
reached through the DM header's own "Call" button rather than a rail row,
and published to LiveKit under `channel-<dmChannelId>` - the same
`room_for_channel` scheme every channel kind already shares - so this reuses
e2e_voice's SFU checks rather than duplicating them.

Bob reaches the DM by its channel id rather than by clicking its rail row:
once alice has opened it, "Bob"/"Alice" name both a member-pane row and a
Direct-messages rail row with the identical text, and this harness's click()
picks whichever tappable match sorts first - not something worth resting a
scenario on when the server can just be asked for the id it already knows.

Alice's own first click needs the identical care, for a reason worth writing
down: the API sweep (`e2e_sweep.py`) opens a DM with Bob from alice's own
account as a side effect of exercising the DMs route, and once anything
prompts alice's client to refresh its channel list - a voice call's join or
leave already does - that DM gets a rail row too, before this scenario ever
runs. From there, "Bob" starts matching a rail row as well as the member
pane's, and once alice is already sitting on that DM channel (whichever
"Bob" click landed on it), "Message" (meant for the profile popover's own
button) no longer matches anything on screen - except the header's pin icon,
whose label, "Pinned messages", contains "message" as a substring. That
opened the pinned-messages sheet over the composer instead of ever finding
one, which reads as a missing composer with no clue that a sheet is why.
Checking the API for what alice's own account already has sidesteps the
whole ambiguity rather than trying to out-guess it with a choosier label.

Run after the shared 'lounge' voice scenarios rather than beside them, so a
call already open in one room can never collide with the other.

L.DM_CALL joins directly now, the same as a voice channel row (PR #354
removed the join lobby both used), so the click below is the join itself;
see e2e_voice.join_call's own doc comment for the fuller reasoning.
