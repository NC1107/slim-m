"""Every local `Source` in the rpm spec is copied by every workflow that builds it.

`rpmbuild` reads its inputs from one flat `SOURCES` directory, and each workflow
that builds the rpm populates that directory with its own hand-written `cp`.
There are four of them. Adding a `Source` to the spec and updating fewer than
four is a build that passes review, passes every PR check, and then fails on
main - which is exactly what happened on 2026-09-22 when `slim-m-client.repo`
was added to `release.yml`'s two copies but not to `main-builds.yml`'s or
`copr-publish.yml`'s:

    install: cannot stat '/w/rpmbuild/SOURCES/slim-m-client.repo'

No PR check builds the rpm, so nothing could have caught it earlier. This can.

Stdlib only; hygiene installs nothing.

    Not a single `cp` either: a job may copy the bulk of its sources in one
    command and the built tarball in another, and requiring every source in
