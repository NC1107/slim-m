"""A reply's quote, rendered live on both sides, and what an honest failure
looks like once its parent is gone.

'Reply' itself lives behind the same long-press/right-click context menu as
report and block (see e2e_admin.py's own module doc for why a synthetic
pointer event cannot open it), so the reply is sent through the API here,
the same substitution that module already makes. Everything downstream - the
rendered quote, its tap target, and what a deleted parent looks like - is an
ordinary `Semantics` node with no menu behind it, so all of that is driven
and checked through the real UI.
