# Detects the exact silent failure release.yml's own concurrency shape
# produced on 2026-08-06: a release-please manifest bumped to a new version
# (its release PR merged) with no matching git tag, because the run that
# should have cut it was cancelled while pending behind another. Nothing
# else notices this - the merge looks identical to a normal one, and the
# missing tag is the only trace. See CLAUDE.md's "A release can succeed and
# still ship no store build" entry and docs/ci.md's release section.
#
# A fresh gap is normal, not a bug: the same push that merges a release PR
# usually cuts its tag within that same run, a minute or two later.
# GRACE_SECONDS is how long that is allowed to take before a gap is reported
# as stuck rather than in-flight. NOW_EPOCH is overridable so a test can run
# this against fixed history instead of the real clock.
