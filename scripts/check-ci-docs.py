"""Every workflow appears in the table `docs/ci.md` opens with.

CLAUDE.md sends a reviewer to `docs/ci.md` as the authoritative list before
judging any workflow, and that instruction is only as good as the list. Six
of twenty-one workflows were missing from it when this was written, and one
of the six was the reason it mattered: `desktop-clients.yml` held
`contents: write` and uploaded release assets while declaring no
`environment`, unlike every asset-publishing job in `release.yml`. Nobody
reviewing the documented set could have noticed, because it was not in the
documented set.

So this checks the direction that actually rots. A workflow is added far more
often than the table is remembered, and an undocumented workflow is invisible
rather than wrong-looking, which is the kind of gap that survives review.

The reverse direction is checked too, since a row naming a workflow that no
longer exists sends a reader looking for a file that was deleted or renamed.

Only the glance table is required. A dedicated prose section is not: several
workflows are adequately described by their row, and demanding a section for
each would push toward padding rather than explanation.
