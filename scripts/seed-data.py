"""Fills a deployment with varied, realistic-looking chat activity.

Creates a channel named for today's date, then N accounts (default 10) that
by default are the *same* accounts a previous run against this deployment
already created (see "Repeat runs" below), acting in parallel: short and
long messages, emoji, markdown, real code functions across several
languages, links (video, article, image, repo), mentions, polls,
attachments, replies, threads, reactions, edits, deletes, and pins, picked
at random from a weighted set so the result reads like an uneven real
conversation rather than a uniform sample. Target selection for reactions
and threads is recency-weighted (see scripts/lib/seed_state.py) and a
settle pass at the end (scripts/lib/seed_settle.py) both guarantees a
message can carry several different emoji or one emoji from several
different reactors, and opens brand new, multi-reply threads on the newest
messages specifically - so the screenful anyone actually opens a channel to
look at is not the barest part of it. Drives plain REST, reusing
scripts/lib/e2e_api.py rather than a second HTTP client.

With --ollama, the chat itself is not drawn from pools of disconnected
lines: scripts/lib/seed_conversation.py asks the model for a handful of
whole, structured multi-speaker conversations - real participant names,
who replies to whom, which turn opens a side thread, who reacts with what -
in one call each, and scripts/lib/seed_replay.py sends the result turn by
turn. A conversation the model garbles past usefulness is dropped rather
than sent; --ollama absent, or every conversation unusable, falls all the
way back to the pooled-and-templated behaviour this script always had.

Repeat runs against the same deployment reuse the same accounts by default:
--username-tag is empty unless given (so a persona's username is the same,
e.g. seed-alan, every run) and the shared password is cached per deployment
under ~/.cache/slim-m-seed/ unless --password overrides it, so
register_accounts logs into an account that is already registered instead
of minting a fresh one. Pass --username-tag to get a separate, fresh cohort
alongside whatever already exists instead.

The server's attachment upload sniffs content type from the bytes it is
given, never from a filename or a declared Content-Type header (see
crates/slimm-server/src/media/content_type.rs's ALLOWED_TYPES) - 13 entries
as of the 2026-08-04 widening: the original five images and pdf, plus
video/mp4, video/webm, audio/mpeg, audio/ogg, audio/wav, application/zip,
application/gzip and text/plain. Nothing outside that set can be attached
at all: anything else gets a 400 "unsupported attachment type" regardless
of extension. scripts/lib/seed_media.py generates real, varied PNGs (wide,
tall, small, a medium "screenshot", and one near the default per-upload
ceiling), one genuinely structured PDF, a plain-text log, a real zip
archive, and a real PCM WAV tone - all stdlib-only, so always present - plus
a short, genuinely valid mp4 clip via ffmpeg's synthetic test source when
ffmpeg is on PATH, skipped with a printed reason rather than a failure when
it is not. webm and ogg are not generated: ffmpeg can produce both, but one
real video and one real audio fixture already exercises the new types
without doubling the generator surface for no visible difference in the
transcript. Large code and log-shaped reference content still mostly rides
message text as fenced code blocks too, which the server has no format
restriction on at all. Video beyond the one generated clip is still covered
by links (see scripts/lib/seed_links.py) rather than more generated files.

Two things it does not do. It cannot fabricate a message's timestamp - the
server stamps every write with its own clock - so a single run cannot force
a day-divider across a real midnight; run it again on a later day against
the same deployment for that. And cleanup is not its job: it prints every
account, the channel, and the shared password it created, so a person can
find and remove them by hand.

    python3 scripts/seed-data.py --base-url http://localhost:8080 --confirm

An already-claimed deployment (one that already has an admin account) needs
that admin's credentials, to create the channel and mint an invite if the
join policy requires one:

    python3 scripts/seed-data.py --base-url http://localhost:8080 --confirm \\
        --admin-username alice --admin-password ... --invite-code XYZ

Nothing here has a default target, and nothing writes without --confirm; see
scripts/lib/seed_guard.py for why, and for the extra flag the one documented
live deployment needs on top of that.
