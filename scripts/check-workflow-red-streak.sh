# Some workflows fail without anything else noticing. e2e.yml is advisory and
# does not run on pull_request (see its own header), so a red run there never
# failed a PR or blocked a release - twice that silence let a multi-day
# regression ship underneath two releases (PRs #379 and #550, both
# "e2e was red"). main-builds.yml is worse in a quieter way: it is what puts a build
# on a phone between releases, so a red run there means no build is being
# produced and the only evidence is a colour on a tab nobody has open.
# A second red workflow does not fix that: a workflow's own colour is
# exactly the signal nobody was watching the first time. This script's
# actual output is a GitHub issue, opened once a real streak is found and
# closed automatically once a run on main succeeds again, deduplicated on
# a label so it cannot spam one per run. A single failure never opens one;
# see the FAILURE_THRESHOLD default below for why 3 was chosen over 1.
#
# Which workflow is watched, and the prose naming why it matters, are the
# only things that vary between callers; everything else is shared, so a
# second watched workflow costs a job rather than a second script.
#
# Decision logic only touches run history, never the live repo, so
# scripts/lib/test_check_workflow_red_streak.py drives it against a fixture
# run list via E2E_RUNS_JSON rather than a real red workflow. Issue management
# is driven through gh CLI porcelain (issue list/create/close, label
# create) so the same tests can fake `gh` on PATH, the technique
# scripts/lib/test_verify_release_checks.py already uses.
