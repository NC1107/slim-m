# 0056 - activity carries a source label and Spotify cover art, and linking says what happened

Status: accepted, 2026-10-01.
Amends [0044](0044-rich-presence.md), which said art would never be a sender-supplied URL.

## The report

The owner, on the live deployment, across three backlog messages and his answers:

> "show what I'm playing on Spotify on phone opens browser to do functionality, can it just open the app where I'm already logged in?"
> "i click agree, it flips me back to the app but nothing happens"
> "I guess there is just no visual confirmation? ... after I press agree anything happens, the tab doesn't close, and I don't feel like I integrated with Spotify, the one way I got the playing working was the native media player listener"
> "listening box ... this is technically a youtube video not my spotify music currently playing"
> "album covers from Spotify songs would be nice but ... not sure if the integration was working or if that was from native media listener"

## What was found

- The redirect `slimm://spotify-callback?code&state` reached the router as well as the deep-link stream.
  go_router read the empty path as `/`, so the open Settings modal was replaced by the channels screen and nothing said the link had finished.
  `spotify_callback_route_test.dart` reproduces this through Flutter's `pushRouteInformation` channel.
- The only record of a link attempt lived in a future held by the process.
  If the OS killed the app while the browser was open, the redirect had nothing to finish.
- Any error that was not a Spotify, timeout or client exception (a bad JSON reply) left `link()` with an unhandled exception.
- There is no Android or iOS now-playing listener in this repo.
  On a phone the Spotify link is the only source.
  The "native media player listener" that worked is the Linux MPRIS source (or Windows SMTC), which reads browsers too.

## Decision: link feedback

- A pending link (verifier, state, start time) is stored in the key store, so the redirect completes it even after a cold start.
- The deep-link controller owns the redirect: it consumes it, never routes it, and a small `WidgetsBindingObserver` registered before the router swallows the matching route information so Settings stays open.
- Settings shows the state in place under the Spotify switch: waiting (with Cancel), connecting, `Connected as <name>` (with Disconnect), or a persistent `AppErrorState` with Retry.
- Every redirect outcome has a message: success, consent denied, state mismatch or expired, nothing pending while linked (ignored), nothing pending while not linked (expired), a refused or unreadable token reply, an unreachable network.
  The `error` text in the URL is never shown, since any app can open that link.
- After a redirect that arrives while Settings is not open (a cold start), the app opens the Profile pane so the result is visible.
- The name is `display_name` from `GET /v1/me`, which needs no extra scope.
  If that call fails the row says `Connected to Spotify`.
- The browser tab staying open is out of our hands: the page after "Agree" is Spotify's, and a custom-scheme redirect hands control to the app without closing the tab.
  Nothing on that page can be changed without a redirect page we host, which would add a server hop for a cosmetic gain.

## Decision: app-to-app login, not built

Spotify documents app-switch authorization only through its Android and iOS SDKs, which are a native dependency and a different flow from the PKCE one 0044 chose.
Whether `accounts.spotify.com/authorize` opens the installed Spotify app from a browser intent depends on the device and the app's link claims, and could not be verified without a phone.
So it is not built.
Steps for the owner to test on a real phone, with the build that has a client id:

1. Install the Spotify app, sign in, then turn the Spotify switch on in slim-m.
2. Note whether the consent page opens in the Spotify app, in a browser that is already signed in, or asks for a password.
3. Tap Agree and note whether slim-m comes forward and the row reads `Connected as <your name>`.
4. If the browser asks for a password every time, the next step is an in-app auth session (`ASWebAuthenticationSession`, Custom Tabs), which shares the browser's login and is a plugin, not the Spotify SDK.

## Decision: source label and art on the wire

Two optional fields on `PresenceActivity`, additive:

- `source`: at most 32 characters, never empty, the shared hidden-character check.
  MPRIS fills it with the player's `Identity` ("Spotify", "Mozilla Firefox"), the Spotify link with "Spotify".
  Viewers read "Listening on Firefox" instead of mistaking a video for Spotify.
  The device's own Settings line also says which feed is sending: the Spotify link or this computer's player.
- `art_url`: accepted only as `https://i.scdn.co/image/` followed by exactly 40 lowercase hex characters.
  No other host, port, userinfo, query or fragment, and the server refuses anything else with 400 rather than dropping it.

Why a URL at all, when 0044 refused one: the risk was a sender making other clients (or the server) request an arbitrary address.
An exact pattern on one CDN host removes that: the server never fetches it, and a viewer's client only ever contacts Spotify's image CDN.
The client applies the same rule before drawing, so an old or hostile server cannot widen it.
The remaining cost is that a viewer's IP address reaches Spotify's CDN when they open a card showing Spotify art.
That is accepted because the sender chose to share a Spotify track, and nothing is proxied or stored.
Art from any other source (a browser video thumbnail, a local file URL) never leaves the device: the sender drops it and the card shows a placeholder.
Adding a host later is one edit to `is_allowed_art_url` plus its client twin and this record.

Spotify's `currently-playing` reply already carries `item.album.images`, so no scope changes: still `user-read-currently-playing`.
MPRIS `mpris:artUrl` is passed through only when it satisfies the same rule, which is what Spotify's desktop app reports.
Windows SMTC and the macOS source are unchanged; their art and player name are not read.

Everything stays off by default, and appear-offline still stops both feeds from opening and the server from announcing.
