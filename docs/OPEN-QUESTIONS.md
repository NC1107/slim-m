# Open questions for the owner

Things an autonomous run could not settle on its own, accumulated as they came up.
Each entry says what is blocked, why it needs a person, and what the run did instead.

Nothing here is a request for permission to do ordinary work.
These are the cases where proceeding under any assumption would be guessing, or where the check genuinely needs hardware or an account only the owner holds.

**Started 2026-07-31.**
Newest sections at the bottom, so the order is the order they were found.

---

## 1. Device confirmation nobody here can do

Three changes shipped this week are correct as far as unit tests and traced library source can establish, and none of them can be confirmed without hardware in your hands.
This matters more than it normally would, because an iOS screen-share fix was recorded as done on 2026-07-29 on exactly that basis and a real device later disproved it.

- **Screen share on iOS** (client 0.16.0 and later). Start a share from a call and confirm it survives past the first few seconds rather than raising "Screen Recording has stopped".
- **CallKit background execution** ([#212](https://github.com/NC1107/slim-m/issues/212), merged in #231). Start a call from the app's own UI, background the app, and confirm the call keeps running and appears in the Dynamic Island.
- ~~**The camera pre-toggle** (#231).~~ **Joining a call with the camera on** (#231, then removed with the join lobby on 2026-08-03, then rebuilt as a persisted Voice Settings toggle in PR #546 on 2026-08-11 - so the thing to confirm is that toggle rather than the lobby control the original entry meant). This box has no webcam, so the capture path itself has never run.
- **The lock-screen push preview** (2026-08-11). Lock the phone, have somebody send a message, and confirm the notification names the sender and shows the text rather than saying "New message". Two separate things could make it fall back and look identical from the outside: the keychain refusing to hand the extension the push key on a locked screen, or the sealed box failing to open. What *is* proven is the decryption itself, by an XCTest that opens real server-produced ciphertext on a macOS runner (see `crates/slimm-server/tests/push_envelope_fixture.rs`); what is not proven is that a real ReplayKit-free extension process on a real locked device reaches that code with a key in hand.

*What the run did instead:* covered each with unit tests against fakes, and said plainly in every PR body that device confirmation is outstanding rather than calling them done.

## 2. Android has never had a call held on it

`RECORD_AUDIO` was missing from the Android manifest from the day voice shipped until #231, so a call on Android could never have captured audio.
Nothing caught it because no Android device has ever been available, and no CI check can see a missing runtime permission.

That permission is declared now, but the fix is unverified, and the same blind spot still covers the whole Android call path plus the last Phase 3 exit criterion (a real backgrounded Android device receiving a content-free push).

*Question:* is an Android device likely to be available at some point, or should the Android call path be treated as unsupported and said so in the docs rather than shipped untested?

## 3. `VoipPushRegistrar` is dead code, and waking it up is risky

[#230](https://github.com/NC1107/slim-m/issues/230). `VoipPushRegistrar` is declared in `VoipCallHandler.swift` and constructed nowhere, so the inbound VoIP push path does not run at all, despite a passing XCTest suite that has been guarding it.

This was deliberately not fixed autonomously. Constructing it turns a dormant path into a live one that must be correct on the very first push, because iOS terminates an app that receives a VoIP push and does not report a call synchronously. The failure mode is the app being killed, on your phone, with no local way to test it first.

*Question:* do you want this wired up, accepting that the first confirmation is a real push to your own device?

## 4. Things only your accounts can do

- **Play internal testers.** There is no Play Developer API credential anywhere on this box; `~/.secrets/slim-m/` holds only the Firebase service account, which is scoped to messaging. Tester lists live in Play Console and each tester must accept an opt-in link.
- **Reviewer protection on the `release` and `testflight` GitHub Environments.** They exist and are ungated.
- **An optional GPG signing secret** for the Linux client checksums.

## 5. Continuous deployment now reaches production without a human

Since #228, a merge to main touching `crates/**` pushes `latest`, and Watchtower deploys it to `https://slim.npc-server.top` on its own.
That was your explicit instruction and it is working, but it is worth stating once in a durable place: the safety property is now "main is always good" rather than "somebody chose to release".

*Question:* if that turns out to be too loose, the cheap correction is to keep pushing the sha and `main` tags on every merge but move `latest` back to tagged releases only. Say the word and it is one line.

## 6. Decisions left open in the knowledge base

Carried forward from `CLAUDE.md`'s own owner list, unchanged by this run:

- ~~Whether to keep release-please's standing release PR or move to manual tag-based releases.~~ Settled 2026-08-01 without needing to choose: see section 19. The standing PRs stayed; the conflict that made this question urgent was fixed at its source instead.
- Where, if anywhere, a flatpak build should be published ~~once the manifest exists~~ - the condition is met as of 2026-08-05, so this is a live question rather than a conditional one.
  `packaging/flatpak/top.npcserver.slimm.yaml` exists, `release.yml` builds a bundle from it and attaches it to the GitHub release, and Flathub is still only noted as tracked future scope in Phase 9.

## 7. The next client build wipes its own message cache, once

Message reconciliation landed on 2026-07-31 (#235, #236, #237, #238), closing the debt where an edit or a delete made while a client was offline never reached it.

Part of that is a drift schema bump to v7 that **drops every cached message and rewinds the sync cursor**, on every device, the first time it runs.

That is deliberate and it is not avoidable.
Edits and deletes made before the server had an op stream to record them in are unrecoverable by any mechanism: no cursor reaches behind the first op ever written, so a message this cache holds a stale copy of would stay stale forever.
Dropping the cache once is the only thing that closes that epoch.

*What you will see:* open the app after updating and each channel refetches its newest 50 messages.
Anything older is refetched by scrolling, exactly as it is on a fresh install.
Channels, read markers and unsent drafts are untouched; only the message cache goes.

*Not a question, just something you should not have to diagnose in the moment.*
If it looks like data loss rather than a refetch, that would be a real bug and worth reporting.

## 8. ~~Nothing verifies reconciliation on a real pair of devices~~ (the harness half was built the same day; struck 2026-08-11)

**The question at the bottom was answered by somebody building it, and this entry never said so.**
It is also contradicted by section 10 further down this same file, which refers to "the new reconciliation scenario" as an existing thing on 2026-07-31 - a grep of this file against itself would have caught it.

`scripts/lib/e2e_reconcile.py` is that scenario, and it does exactly what this entry says the harness could not express: one client navigates away to a blank page while the other edits one message and deletes another, then comes back and is asserted to show the new text and not the deleted message, with nobody telling it to refresh.
Navigating away rather than killing the browser is deliberate, so the profile and drift's IndexedDB survive holding the old text - there has to be something stale for catch-up to correct.
It runs on every PR as part of the `e2e` workflow.

~~Every property of the op stream is covered by unit and integration tests, and the mutation tests confirm each one can fail.~~
~~What none of that proves is the thing the feature exists for: edit a message on your phone while your desktop is closed, reopen the desktop, and see the new text.~~
~~`scripts/e2e.sh` drives two browsers and would be the natural place for it, but it holds both clients open throughout, so it cannot currently express "one client is away while the other writes".~~
~~*Question:* worth growing the e2e harness to close and reopen one client mid-run, or is confirming it by hand across your own two devices enough?~~

*What is genuinely still open,* and it is narrower than the original: this is two browser profiles on one box, not your phone and your desktop.
Nothing here proves the same thing across two real devices on two networks, and no CI harness can.

## 9. ~~The client release PR is stuck~~ (closed 2026-08-01, and the diagnosis held exactly)

**Closed.** Client **0.18.0** is released and on TestFlight.
The fix was the one predicted below and nothing else: merging a client-affecting change ([#259](https://github.com/NC1107/slim-m/pull/259)) made release-please regenerate the standing PR, which went from `CONFLICTING` to `MERGEABLE` within about two minutes and merged cleanly, with no generated file touched by hand.
The reconciliation work is now on your devices as well as the server.

The *question* at the end is now the live part, and **it happened a third time within the hour**, in the other direction: merging client 0.19.0 conflicted the standing **server** 0.22.1 release PR.

So this is a pattern rather than three incidents, and the threshold I set for reconsidering has been met.
The new information is the cost, which the earlier entries did not state: a component with **no pending work of its own** stays unreleasable until unrelated work happens to touch it.
Server 0.22.1 is a test-only fix with nothing server-side queued behind it, so nothing was going to unstick it on its own.
A conflicted PR also runs **no CI at all**, so the state is worse than it looks - not a slow queue, nothing running.

~~*My recommendation, for your call:* switch to the manual tag-based flow already listed in section 6.~~
~~It has no standing PR to go stale, it matches the zero-open-PRs preference recorded there, and the release jobs already keep their `refs/tags/client-v` and `refs/tags/server-v` branches, so hand-tagging is a supported path rather than a workaround.~~
~~What it costs is that the changelog stops being generated for you, which is the thing release-please is actually buying.~~
**Superseded 2026-08-01, before you had to make that call.** The manual-tag switch would have paid for the fix with the changelog; it turned out not to be the only way to pay. See section 19: the two standing PRs were made to stop sharing the one file they were actually conflicting on, which removes the conflict without removing release-please.

The original entry follows, kept because the reasoning is what made the fix predictable rather than lucky.


Server 0.21.0 is released and deployed; the live instance reports it, so migration 0027 has run against production.

The matching client release ([#229](https://github.com/NC1107/slim-m/pull/229), 0.17.0) is **conflicted and was left that way deliberately**.

What happened is understood rather than guessed: release-please only refreshes a component's standing PR when that component has new releasable commits.
Nothing client-facing merged after #238, so it left its own branch untouched while merging the server release moved `.release-please-manifest.json` underneath it.
The conflict is on that file plus `client/CHANGELOG.md` and `client/pubspec.yaml`, all three generated.

It was not forced, because every available shortcut (hand-resolving, deleting the branch, editing the changelog) means editing generated files by hand, which `CLAUDE.md` forbids and which this project's own notes flag as something to watch rather than push through.

*What unsticks it:* merging **any** client-affecting change to main. release-please then regenerates the PR cleanly and it becomes mergeable again.
Until that happens the message reconciliation work is on the server but not on any of your devices.

*Question:* if this recurs often enough to be annoying, the alternative is the manual tag-based release flow already listed in section 6, which has no standing PR to go stale.

## 10. An e2e run can silently exercise last week's code

`E2E_REBUILD=1` rebuilds the client from whatever the working tree holds, and nothing in the harness notices the tree is behind `origin/main`.

This cost a full rebuild cycle on 2026-07-31: an e2e run that looked thorough, and passed 19 of 20 scenarios, was built from a checkout predating the whole reconciliation series - the tree had been fetched but never pulled, so it contained no `message_ops_sync.dart` and no migration 0027.

The failing scenario was the new reconciliation one, which is the only reason it was caught at all.
That turned out to be a useful accident (it is a real mutation test: the scenario fails when the feature is absent, and fails on its own assertion rather than on a timeout), but the harness should not depend on luck for this.

~~*Suggested guard, not built:*~~ **Built 2026-08-01.** `scripts/e2e.sh` prints the commit it is building from, warns by count when the tree is behind `origin/main`, and notes an uncommitted working tree.
Done without waiting for agreement after all, on the grounds that it only adds output: it changes no behaviour, refuses nothing, and cannot fail a run that would otherwise pass.
It deliberately does **not** refuse to run when behind, because working from a deliberately older tree is a legitimate thing to do (that is how the reconciliation scenario got mutation-tested), and a guard that blocks it would be worked around rather than heeded.

*What is still open:* nothing here notices that the **web build** is older than the tree, which is a different staleness and the one `E2E_REBUILD` exists for.
A run without that flag reuses a cached build, so the commit this now prints is the commit of the *checkout*, not necessarily of the bundle being exercised.

## 11. How long does a canvas live? (owner's own question, undecided)

Raised while using the product on 2026-07-31, and recorded here because it is a product decision with schema consequences rather than something the next contributor should settle by picking one.

> unsure how to handle canvases, like are they forever spaces, or is it like teams where every meeting is a new meeting and chat and the canvas changes after each meeting and is just an artifact or something, or should it persist for as long as the call exists, and people clear it as they need or save/export it as they need

Three models, none chosen:

1. **Permanent per channel.** What ships today: `canvas_objects` is keyed per channel with no notion of a session, and the op stream is keyed the same way.
2. **Per call, becoming an artifact.** Each call starts a fresh canvas and the previous one is kept as something you can open but not draw on. Needs a session id on every object and op, and a decision about where artifacts are listed.
3. **Lives as long as the call**, cleared or exported by hand.

The reason this cannot be deferred indefinitely: 1 is the only one the current schema expresses, and 2 and 3 both need a session key threaded through `canvas_objects`, `canvas_ops` and every read, which is a migration over a table that will have real content by then.
The longer the canvas is used, the more expensive the other two become.

*Question:* which of the three, or something else? The `save/export` half is a separate feature in every model and does not need answering at the same time.

## 12. Making an autonomous run actually span a week needs one decision from you

The standing instruction was to iterate for a week with no interference.
A single session cannot span a week, and the in-session scheduler (`CronCreate`) is session-only: it dies the moment the session ends, so it does not either.

The mechanism to do it properly exists and was verified on 2026-07-31: `claude` is on PATH at `~/.local/bin/claude` and takes `-p` for non-interactive runs, so a system crontab entry could resume the loop daily.

**It was not set up, deliberately.** An unattended run needs `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`, since nobody is there to approve tool calls, and that produces this chain:

> cron -> agent with permission checks disabled -> merges to `main` -> Watchtower deploys `latest` -> the live instance at `slim.npc-server.top`

plus TestFlight and Play builds from any `client-v*` tag it cuts.
For seven days, unobserved.

Every individual link is already how this project works and is your own deliberate setup.
What is new is removing the human from the loop *and* the permission prompts at the same time, which is different from an observed session where each step is seen as it happens.
The blast radius if a run goes wrong is your live deployment and your store builds, and neither is quick to walk back.

*Question, and it is a one-word answer:*

- **Yes** - and the crontab line is roughly `23 9 * * * claude -p "<the loop prompt>" --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions >> ~/.cache/slimm-autorun.log 2>&1`, with the loop prompt already written (it is the `CronCreate` job from that session).
- **Yes, but not to production** - the same thing with the release PRs left unmerged, so a person still cuts every release. This is the middle option and is probably the right one: the work still happens daily, and the only thing waiting on you is the button that ships it.
- **No** - and the honest consequence is that "for a week" means "resume it when you next open a session", which is what happens today.

The middle option is the recommendation.
It keeps the deploy decision human while losing almost nothing, since merging a standing release PR takes seconds and is the one step where a bad change becomes irreversible.

## 14. ~~The release gate checks the wrong commit~~ (fixed 2026-08-01, same day)

**Fixed.** `verify-release-checks.yml` takes a `ref` input, and `release.yml` passes release-please's own created tag on the release path.
The tag-push path is unchanged and still uses `github.sha`, which is correct there because the tag is what triggered the run.

Verified against live data rather than by reasoning, replaying the gate's own logic over the real check runs:
`server-v0.23.0` and `client-v0.20.0` each carry every one of their required checks at `success`, so both would now pass.
The commit the broken gate actually looked at (`72f1a36`, the client-only merge) has `hygiene` and the licence check but **no `check` at all**, which is precisely the timeout that skipped the publish jobs.

That the release commit always carries its component's checks is not luck: it edits the version files each component's CI is path-filtered on.

**Server 0.23.0's own artifacts stay missing**, and that is deliberate.
Republishing means deleting and re-pushing a tag that already has a GitHub release attached, which is a destructive act against published metadata to recover two things nothing is currently blocked on: the ability to pin `0.23.0` specifically, and the static binaries.
The deployment has the code through `latest`, and the next server release will be complete.
Say so if you would rather have them and I will do it.

**The first version of this fix had a bug of its own, and client 0.20.1 paid for it.**
The check-runs API path accepts a tag, so passing the tag straight through looked correct and the gate did verify the right commit.
The fast-fail branch underneath it queries `actions/runs?head_sha=`, which accepts a **SHA only** - given a tag name it returns zero runs, so the gate read "nothing is still running", decided the missing check would never appear, and failed 300 seconds in.
What was actually missing was `ios unit tests (callkit invariant)`, which had simply not started yet; `client-ios-ci` takes about thirteen minutes and was still `in_progress` well after the gate gave up.
The ref is resolved to a SHA once at the top now and everything downstream uses that.
Measured on the commit that broke: the tag returns 0 runs, the resolved SHA returns 6, one of them the in-progress iOS job the gate needed to wait for.

Worth recording rather than quietly fixing, because the shape recurs: **an identifier that two APIs both accept, where only one of them accepts both forms.**
The failure is silent and reads as the opposite of what it is - a gate that gives up early looks like a check that failed.

**Client 0.20.1's artifacts are missing for the same reason 0.23.0's are**, and cannot be recovered by re-running: a tag-triggered run reads the workflow file from the tagged commit, which predates the fix.
The day-divider fix is on main and reaches a device with the next client release.

The original entry follows.

### The original diagnosis

**Server 0.23.0's publish jobs were all skipped.** The tag and the GitHub release exist and look perfectly normal; there are no static binaries attached and no `0.23.0` tag on the container image.

The deployment is fine and needed no intervention: images are pushed per main commit and `latest` moved to the release commit, so watchtower picked it up and the live instance reports 0.23.0 with the channel-reorder route on it. What is missing is the ability to *pin* that version, and the downloadable binaries.

**The mechanism, which is exact rather than inferred.**
`release.yml`'s `verify-server-ci` gate polls the check runs on `github.sha` - the commit that *triggered* the workflow run.
`release-please` inside that same run does not act on `github.sha`; it acts on the repository's current state through the API.
Those two are normally identical and diverged here: a client-only merge (#273) started a run, and the server release PR was merged while that run was still going, so release-please created server 0.23.0 and reported `server_released=true` **from a run whose `github.sha` was the client-only commit**.

`server-ci` is path-filtered to `crates/**`, `schema/openapi.yaml`, the Cargo files and the Dockerfile, so it correctly never ran on that client-only commit.
The gate then waited for a `check` that could not exist, timed out, and failed, and every publish job is `needs: verify-server-ci`.

So the failure needs no misconfiguration and no cancelled check.
It needs only two merges close enough together that a run outlives the state it was started for, which is exactly how this repository is worked on.

**The fix, not built:** gate on the commit being released rather than on `github.sha`. `release-please` already outputs the tag it created, so the released SHA is available in the same job that currently passes `github.sha` down.
Left unbuilt because it changes the release path, which is the one path where a wrong guess is expensive and invisible, and because it is worth deciding alongside section 13 - both are the same underlying question of what the gate is really asserting about.

**A second thing to know, worth more than the first:** every symptom here was a *green* release.
The tag, the GitHub release and the changelog all looked right; only reading the individual job conclusions showed four skips.
That is now the third distinct way this repository has produced a release that looks correct and is not (0.17.0's cancelled check, this, and the changelog gap below), so a release being green should not be taken as a release being complete.

## 15. Client 0.20.0 shipped a feature its changelog does not mention (2026-08-01)

`client/CHANGELOG.md` for 0.20.0 lists the jump-to-message and channel-reorder work and not the message text selection (#274), which is in the release.

My mistake, and the mechanism is worth recording because it is not obvious: I merged #274 and then merged the standing release PR before `release-please` had regenerated it, so the changelog in that PR predated the commit.
The tag then landed *after* #274, so the code shipped, and because the next release's commit range starts after this tag, that entry will never appear in any changelog.

Not corrected, deliberately: `CHANGELOG.md` is generated and hand-editing it is forbidden here, and this project's notes already record somebody trying exactly that patch-up on client 0.8.0.
The user-facing impact is nil, since the what's-new screen carries the feature and that is what a person actually sees.

*The rule this needs:* after merging anything that affects a component, its standing release PR has to be allowed to regenerate before being merged.
`MERGEABLE` is not the signal - the PR was mergeable the whole time, it was just stale.

## 16. ~~Does the voice lobby screen earn its place?~~ (answered by shipping option 1, 2026-08-03)

**Closed, struck 2026-08-11 by a sweep rather than by anybody answering it.**
Option 1 was built: `d190a711` ("self camera/screen preview, live camera controls, and direct voice join", PR #354) deleted the lobby, and clicking a voice channel joins directly now.
The roster did survive exactly as option 1 predicted, in the rail; `_WhoIsHere` also still renders inside `voice_join_preview.dart`, which kept its name but now holds only the non-connected states (connecting, confirming a switch between two calls, an explicit rejoin).
The camera pre-toggle that option 3 was arguing for landed separately as a persisted Voice Settings preference in PR #546, so nothing this question was weighing is still outstanding.
The recommendation here was option 2 and the owner effectively took option 1; recorded rather than quietly deleted, since a recommendation that was not followed is worth knowing about.

The original question follows.

You have said twice that the join-preview screen "has no purpose" and "is not earning its place", and `docs/BACKLOG.md` records it as a standing view rather than a passing remark.
It is the last open entry in that backlog that is not the camera work, so it is worth settling rather than carrying.

**Why it has not just been deleted.** The same screen is where `_WhoIsHere` renders, which is the roster of who is already in the call before you join.
That was a Phase 4 gap you asked to have closed, it was closed on 2026-07-28, and it is the one thing on the screen that is doing real work.
So "delete the lobby" and "keep being able to see who is in a call before joining" pull against each other, and which one wins is a product call rather than an engineering one.

**Three shapes, none chosen:**

1. **Delete it, join directly.** Tapping a voice channel connects immediately. The roster moves to the rail, which already has it: `voiceRosterProvider` is per-channel and already polls for exactly this, and `VoiceChannelRow` already renders it. Cheapest, and the roster survives.
2. **Keep it only when it has something to say.** Skip straight to the call when the channel is empty, show the preview when somebody is already in it. Avoids a pointless interstitial on the common case without losing the preview when it matters.
3. **Keep it and give it the missing controls.** The backlog's other voice entry is camera pre-toggle, which is exactly the kind of thing a pre-join screen is for; mic pre-toggle already lives there. This is the "it is not earning its place *yet*" reading.

*My recommendation is 2*, because it is the only one that costs nothing when you are wrong: it removes the interstitial precisely when it is empty, and nothing is lost if you later decide you want 1 or 3.

Not built, because all three are one-line-different in effort and the choice is entirely about what you want the app to feel like.

## 13. Should a release wait for a cancelled check, or fail?

`verify-release-checks` treats a **cancelled** required check as a failure.

That is what silently skipped the iOS build for client 0.17.0 on 2026-07-31: merges in quick succession cancelled the in-flight iOS check, the release gate read the cancellation as failure, and `ios-testflight` was skipped while the tag, the GitHub release and the changelog all looked perfectly correct.

#249 fixed the cause - the four release-gating workflows no longer cancel each other on main - so this path should now be unreachable.
**Confirmed on client 0.18.0 (2026-08-01):** `ios-testflight`, `android-client`, `linux-client` and `copr` all ran and all succeeded, on a release cut minutes after several merges in quick succession, which is the exact shape that broke 0.17.0.
Worth saying how that was confirmed, since the failure mode is invisible: the release run's individual job conclusions were read, rather than the release being trusted because it was green.
A release with a skipped store build is green.
The behaviour on the day it *is* reachable again is still the same, though, and the symptom is again a store build that quietly never arrives rather than a red release anybody would notice.

*Question:* should it re-run the cancelled check and keep waiting, or keep failing fast?

Waiting means a release can block for as long as the check takes (the iOS one is about 13 minutes) and could in principle loop.
Failing fast means the release is wrong in the one way nobody sees.
Recorded rather than chosen, because it is a trade about how long you are willing for a release to hang rather than a correctness question.

## 17. ~~iOS image paste via the edit menu needs a real device~~ - closed, confirmed working (2026-08-02)

~~Client 0.21.0's "Paste image" row was built on a prediction - the "Allow Paste?" prompt appears once per install - that the owner's own iPhone disproved: it prompts on every use.~~
~~The fix built in response swizzles Flutter's private `FlutterTextInputView` (`ClipboardPasteBridge.m`) so the long-press edit menu's own Paste item works for an image with no prompt at all, and is reasoned from the engine's own source rather than assumed.~~

~~The device check landed 2026-08-01, and check 1 below failed: the long-press edit menu offers "Scan text" and no Paste at all for a copied image.~~
~~Worse, the "+" sheet's own fallback row had also been hidden on the unproven claim that the swizzle installing meant the menu worked, so there was briefly no way to paste an image at all.~~
~~Not an engine bug and not fixable by patching the swizzle; a real fix needs a custom `contextMenuBuilder` with its own async clipboard-image state.~~
That last line was half right and half not: the fix did need a custom `contextMenuBuilder`, but not a custom *item* - the working shape forces the platform's own standard Paste item into the list rather than building a custom one, because a custom item's tap round-trips through Dart after the gesture is already dispatched and loses the prompt exemption that dispatch depends on.

Closed 2026-08-02, confirmed by the owner on a real iPhone: long-press the composer, the edit menu offers Paste, and it attaches the image with no prompt.
Full mechanism and the two real mistakes made getting there (an unproven claim hiding the working fallback row, and a category on a private engine class breaking the 0.21.2 build) are in `CLAUDE.md`'s "Image paste on iPhone, confirmed working" entry.

~~Nothing about an Objective-C method swizzle, a native pasteboard read, or the "Allow Paste?" prompt's own exemptions can be exercised in this environment, which has no iPhone.~~
~~Two things specifically need confirming on a real device, in this order, because the second is meaningless without the first:~~

~~1. **The menu item appears.** Copy an image (not text), long-press inside the composer's text field, and confirm Paste is offered.~~
Confirmed 2026-08-02: it does.
~~2. **Tapping it attaches the image with no prompt.** The whole point of routing through the system's own dispatch of `paste:` rather than a Dart-triggered read.~~
Confirmed 2026-08-02: it does, by the owner's own report.

Android's clipboard path (the "+" sheet's "Paste image" row, its only route there) remains unverified on a device; it is reasoned from source and covered by unit tests only.

## 18. ~~Threads: which shape, still undecided~~ (built as option 1, 2026-08-01)

**Closed, struck 2026-08-11 by a sweep rather than by an answer.**
The record's own recommendation - a thread as a channel with a parent - was built on 2026-08-01 under a stated assumption, since it is additive and could be walked back.
`channels.parent_message_id` (migration 0030) is the column, `Store::permission_channel` is the single place a thread resolves to its parent for permissions, and nesting is refused outright.
The reply-count affordance and a live `ThreadUpdated` event followed on 2026-08-01 and 2026-08-02.
See CLAUDE.md's "Threads, built from the option 0005 recommended" for what building it actually found.
It is still fair to say the owner never explicitly picked the shape, so if the answer is "no, the cheap filtered view was good enough", saying so is still worth something - but nothing is blocked on it.

The original question follows.

Replies shipped (`crates/slimm-server/migrations/0029_message_replies.sql`, `messages.replyToId`): a message can point at another message, and the transcript shows a compact quote you can tap to jump to it.
Threads, the "hidden sub-channel you click Reply in Thread to open" the owner described, did not, on purpose - see [docs/decisions/0005-threads.md](decisions/0005-threads.md) for the three ways to build it, what each costs in migrations and touched subsystems, and a recommendation.

*Question:* pick a shape (the record recommends a thread as a channel with a parent), or say the cheap filtered-view version is good enough for now, knowing it does not match the Slack model named.

## 20. A live stroke changes colour the instant it commits, and only you can settle which colour is right (2026-08-06)

Two independent reviewers, one reading the interaction and one reading the rendered pixels, flagged the same thing on the same night without seeing each other's work.
That is the reason this is written down rather than decided: neither of them read it as obviously wrong, and neither could find where the intent had ever been recorded.

While somebody is still drawing, their in-flight stroke paints in their own cursor-identity hue - `canvasParticipantColorIndex` gives them a colour, and `CanvasCursorRelay` gives their pointer the same one, so the ink and the cursor read as one person.
The moment the stroke commits it repaints in the single fixed `AppCanvasColors.annotation`, the same colour every stroke uses regardless of who drew it.
So a mark visibly changes hue at the exact moment it lands, which a first-time viewer reads as a glitch.

*Question:* which of the two is the thing this is meant to say?

**Commit in the author's own colour** and the change disappears, at the cost of putting permanent, visible authorship on a shared board.
This product deliberately keeps a canvas unattributed - the moderation events carry no actor on the wire, the activity log renders a withheld moderator passively rather than naming them - and per-author ink would be the first place a canvas says who did what, forever, to everyone.

**Draw in the shared colour** and the change disappears the other way, at the cost of the live cue.
Watching four people draw at once becomes four identical coral lines appearing from nowhere, and the "that is Nick's hand moving" signal that makes a live preview worth having at all is gone.

**Leave it** and the hue change stays, which is what ships today.
It is documented as deliberate in `canvas_live_painters.dart`'s own doc comment, and the argument behind it is real - identity while drawing, anonymity once drawn - it has just never been checked against anybody actually watching it happen.

Nothing here is blocked on the answer; all three are small changes to one painter.

## 19. The release-PR conflict is fixed by removing the shared file, not by removing release-please (2026-08-01)

Section 6 and section 9 both pointed at the same recommendation: switch to manual tagging, because it has no standing PR left to conflict.
That was the right call *given the premise* - that release-please forces both packages through one shared manifest file - but the premise turned out to be wrong, and it was worth five minutes with the tool's own docs to find out before spending the changelog to fix it.

**The cause was one file, not the standing-PR mechanism.** `separate-pull-requests: true` was already on, which is why there were two PRs rather than one combined one. Both still read and wrote the same `.release-please-manifest.json`, because release-please's manifest mode keeps exactly one manifest file per config file, tracking every package that config lists. Merging either PR rewrote that file on the other's branch tip, which is the conflict.

**The fix: two config files and two manifest files, each holding one package, so there is nothing left for the two PRs to share.** `release-please-action` takes `config-file` and `manifest-file` as independent inputs; nothing requires there to be only one pair per repository. `release.yml`'s `release-please` job now calls the action twice - once against `release-please-config.server.json` / `.release-please-manifest.server.json`, once against the `.client.json` pair - and each invocation only ever touches its own package's files. A server release commit cannot conflict a client PR it shares no file with, and vice versa, by construction rather than by timing.

**What this keeps that the manual-tag switch would have given up:** the generated changelog, the standing PRs (so nobody has to remember to hand-tag), and the existing `refs/tags/server-v*` / `refs/tags/client-v*` triggers in `release.yml`, which needed no change - a tag push still bypasses `release-please` entirely and resolves version strings from the ref name, exactly as before.

~~**What still needs a real release to confirm**, since nothing short of GitHub actually running the action can prove it: that `release-please-action` produces the same `<path>--release_created` / `--tag_name` / `--version` output keys when a config file lists only one package as when it listed two (verified against the action's own README, not by triggering a run), and that merging a server-only release no longer touches anything on the client's standing PR's branch. The next server-only and client-only merges are the test.~~

**Confirmed by events, struck 2026-08-11.** The server has gone from 0.22.x to 0.35.0 and the client from 0.19.x to 0.36.0 since this landed, so both output-key sets and both directions of the conflict have been exercised many times over.
No release-PR conflict of the kind sections 6 and 9 describe has recurred; the one release-PR problem since was a different mechanism entirely (a queued run cancelled out of its own concurrency group, keyed on the ref rather than the commit), recorded in CLAUDE.md rather than here.
