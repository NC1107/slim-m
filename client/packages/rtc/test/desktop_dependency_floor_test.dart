/// flutter_webrtc 1.4.0 (the version `livekit_client 2.8.1` hard-pins) has a
/// real bug on Linux: opening a microphone whose device name does not
/// round-trip through its platform-channel encoding throws
/// `FormatException: Unexpected extension byte` out of `getUserMedia`, before
/// `MediaDeviceNative`'s own `on PlatformException` catch ever sees it,
/// because a `FormatException` is not a `PlatformException`. Reproduced
/// directly against the real plugin on a real Fedora KDE box holding a
/// SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset: `getUserMedia({'audio':
/// true})` threw that exact exception in under 10ms, on every call. The
/// owner's reports of the Linux app freezing on join and on enabling the
/// webcam are both a microphone or camera open, so this is the same failure.
///
/// `livekit_client 2.10.0` hard-pins `flutter_webrtc 1.6.0`, past the
/// "sanitize UTF-8 for device strings" fix flutter_webrtc's own changelog
/// records for 1.4.1. Reproduced fixed the same way: the identical probe
/// against 1.6.0/2.10.0 on the same box, with the same real hardware,
/// resolved the call in 6ms instead of throwing.
///
/// This cannot be a behavioural test: the bug only manifests against a real
/// platform channel and a real audio device whose name trips the encoder, and
/// nothing in this repo's test harness has either. What can be pinned is that
/// nobody downgrades past the fix without noticing, which is what this reads
/// out of the resolved lockfile rather than out of pubspec.yaml's own
/// constraint, since a constraint can be satisfied by a version older than
/// intended if something else in the workspace pins lower.
