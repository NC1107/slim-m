/// construction - rather than whatever quality this call was asked for. Left
/// alone, that means the quality ceiling the app applies to every share (see
/// `voice_call_controls.dart`) is a setting that cannot change anything on
/// iOS.
///
/// The fix is LiveKit's own documented escape hatch,
/// `BroadcastManager.shouldPublishTrack`. [setEnabled] sets it false before
/// requesting activation, so the automatic republish becomes a harmless
/// no-op (`_broadcastStateChanged` computes `isBroadcasting &&
/// shouldPublishTrack`, which is false either way while nothing is
/// published), waits for [BroadcastBridge.broadcastingChanges] to report the
/// broadcast actually starting, and only then publishes itself with this
/// call's own options. Restoring `shouldPublishTrack` to true happens after
/// that publish succeeds or fails, never before: while it is false a second
/// native notification resolves to nothing, but once it is back to true the
/// same notification resolves to `unmute()` on the publication this class
