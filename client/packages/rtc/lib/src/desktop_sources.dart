/// Enumerating what a desktop will let this app capture.

/// On desktop this is not optional and not a nicety. `getDisplayMedia` matches
/// the requested id against a list the native plugin only fills in when
/// `getSources` is called, so asking to share without enumerating first fails
/// with `source not found!` no matter what else is right. That was the whole
/// Fedora screen-share bug.
///
/// A second, narrower Linux/desktop gap lives one layer below this file, in
/// flutter_webrtc 1.6.0's own `common/cpp` plugin, and is not closeable from
/// here. `MediaStreamTrackDispose`/`MediaStreamDispose`
/// (`flutter_media_stream.cc`) only call `StopCapture()` on a capturer found
/// in `video_capturers_`, and `GetDisplayMedia` (`flutter_screen_capture.cc`)
/// never registers its `desktop_capturer` into that map - only the camera
/// path (`getUserMedia`) does, so a screen-share track gets no *explicit,
/// immediate* stop call on disposal the way a camera track does.
///
/// That is not the same as "nothing ever stops it": `webrtc-sdk/libwebrtc`'s
/// own `ScreenCapturerTrackSource::~ScreenCapturerTrackSource()` calls
/// `capturer->Stop()`, and its destructor tears down the underlying platform
/// capturer, once every reference the flutter_webrtc plugin itself holds is
/// dropped - which `VoiceSession` already causes on every call-ending path
/// (unpublish, `trackDispose`, `streamDispose`, all reached from
/// `_teardown`/`_onDisconnected`). Whether that reference-counted path is
/// what is actually failing in practice, versus the platform's own recording
/// indicator lagging the capture stopping, is not something this package can
/// tell apart without a real Linux desktop capture session. A small patch to
/// register the desktop capturer the same way the camera path does, closing
/// the gap explicitly rather than leaning on refcounting alone, is proposed
/// upstream rather than carried as a fork - see
/// docs/research/linux-screen-share-teardown-2026-08-11/ for the reasoning
/// and the patch itself.
