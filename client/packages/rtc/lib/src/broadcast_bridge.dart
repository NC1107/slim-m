/// iOS is the one platform where a screen share is not something the app does.

/// separate process, a ReplayKit broadcast upload extension, which the system
/// starts on the user's say-so and which hands frames back through a socket in
/// a shared App Group container.
///
/// Two consequences shape this file. Starting a share is a request, not an
/// action, so "the call returned" does not mean anybody is seeing a screen.
/// And a build can be missing the extension entirely, in which case the
/// request can never succeed, which is worth knowing before asking rather
/// than after waiting.
///
/// `BroadcastManager`, LiveKit's own manual-publish escape hatch (see
