/**
 * The self-managed `android.telecom.ConnectionService` [IncomingCallNotifier]
 * reports every incoming call push to, registered in `AndroidManifest.xml`
 * alongside the `BIND_TELECOM_CONNECTION_SERVICE` permission Telecom
 * requires of the component it binds to.
 *
 * Self-managed rather than a managed (default-dialer) connection service:
 * this app is not, and does not want to be, the phone dialer, and a self-
 * managed connection needs only the normal `MANAGE_OWN_CALLS` permission
 * (granted at install, no runtime prompt) rather than that much broader
 * role. See [SlimmConnection]'s own doc for what this integration does and
 * deliberately does not attempt.
