/// Swizzles two methods on Flutter's own `FlutterTextInputView`, so the
/// system edit menu's Paste item works for an image, not only a string.
/// Confirmed against the engine source itself
/// (`shell/platform/darwin/ios/framework/Source/FlutterTextInputPlugin.{h,mm}`
/// in the flutter/engine repo) rather than assumed.
///
/// That class ships two lines that are the whole obstacle:
/// `canPerformAction:` answers `[UIPasteboard generalPasteboard].hasStrings`
/// for `paste:` with the comment "Forbid pasting images, memojis, or other
/// non-string content," and `paste:` itself only ever reads
/// `UIPasteboard.generalPasteboard.string`. So an image-only pasteboard never
/// even offers the menu item, and could not use it if it did.
///
/// `FlutterTextInputView` is declared only in a private engine header
/// (`Source/FlutterTextInputPlugin.h`), never the public
/// `Flutter.framework/Headers`, and `FLUTTER_DARWIN_EXPORT` on its symbol is
/// debug-build-only. Neither matters here: an Objective-C class's metadata is
/// registered with the runtime for every loaded image regardless of symbol
/// visibility, which is what makes `NSClassFromString` below reliable in a
/// release build too.
///
/// If a future engine upgrade renames the class or either selector, both
/// lookups below fail and this backs out to a no-op rather than swizzling
/// half of a pair or crashing, so a break here reads as "the old prompt-every-
/// time behaviour is back," not as a crash - diagnosable by grepping the
/// engine source at the two paths named above for what moved.
/// The replacements live on a **donor class of our own**, never in a category
/// on the target.
///
/// Confirmed on a real device 2026-08-01: this swizzle installs and is never
/// consulted on this app's own composer field, a plain Material `TextField`.
/// Flutter's default `contextMenuBuilder` on iOS 16+ routes through
/// `SystemContextMenu`, which decides Paste's presence in Dart from
/// `Clipboard.hasStrings()` alone and sends native a fixed item list that
/// bypasses `canPerformAction:` entirely; see CLAUDE.md's "The edit-menu
/// route was never reachable" entry for the full mechanism, file by file.
/// No fix here reaches that - it is a Dart-side widget decision, not an
/// engine bug. Left in place because it still applies to a non-Material
/// field or an iOS below 16 (`UIMenuController`'s traditional
/// `canPerformAction:`-driven path), and failing safe costs nothing; the
/// composer's own "Paste image" row is the route that actually works and is
/// never hidden on this swizzle installing.
///
/// A category on `FlutterTextInputView` emits a link-time reference to
/// `_OBJC_CLASS_$_FlutterTextInputView`, and the engine ships that class
/// without exporting the symbol, so the app fails to link with "Undefined
/// symbol". That is not a theoretical concern: it is exactly how the first
/// version of this file broke the 0.21.2 iOS build, while every Dart test
/// passed. Resolving the class by name at runtime is pointless if the
/// compiler has already been told it exists at link time, and a category is
/// that assertion.
