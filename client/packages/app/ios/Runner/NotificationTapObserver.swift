//
// Something else always does have it: firebase_messaging claims
// `UNUserNotificationCenter.delegate` during plugin registration, and its own
// push handling runs from there. So this chains rather than replaces - every
// callback is passed straight on to the delegate that was installed before it,
// and this class's only addition is reading one key out of `userInfo` on the
// way past.
//
// It exists as its own `NSObject` rather than as methods on `AppDelegate`
// because `FlutterAppDelegate` implements these callbacks while declaring them
// in no public header. Swift cannot see them, so it can neither override them
// nor call `super`, and a subclass method with the same selector would shadow
// the engine's own fan-out to plugins with no way to forward. Conforming to
// `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` directly is ordinary public API and has
// none of that problem.
