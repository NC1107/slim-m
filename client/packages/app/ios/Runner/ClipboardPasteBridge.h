/// plain Material `TextField`, Flutter's `SystemContextMenu` decides Paste's
/// presence in Dart before any native call, so `canPerformAction:` here is
/// never consulted regardless of this return value - see the .m file's doc
/// comment. A caller must still treat NO as "the swizzle itself did not
/// install" (a missing class or selector, failing safe rather than
/// crashing), but must never treat YES as "Paste now works".
