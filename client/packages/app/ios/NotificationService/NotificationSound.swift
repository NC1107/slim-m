// Which sound, if any, a decorated push should play - and the one rule that
// overrides every other answer: a call already in progress must not be
// stepped on by a chime.
//
// The wire carries less than the ideal input here. The relay's own `kind`
// field and the sealed envelope's `PushKind` (crates/slimm-server/src/push/
// envelope.rs) both have exactly one variant, `message`, for every message
// push regardless of whether it is a DM, a mention, or an ordinary channel
// post - there is no mention flag anywhere in this pipeline today, so this
// cannot tell a mention apart from a plain channel message without a wire
// change, which is out of this change's scope. What the decrypted preview
// does carry is `channel`: present for a named channel, absent for a DM or a
// thread reply (see PushEnvelope's own doc comment on `applied(to:)`), so
// that is the one distinction actually available, and mention is left
// unattempted rather than guessed at.
