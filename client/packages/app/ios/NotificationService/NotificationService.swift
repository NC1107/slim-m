// The Notification Service Extension: given a push before iOS shows it, it
// opens the sealed envelope and replaces the relay's generic "New message"
// with the real sender and text, and decides what - if anything - should
// sound. See NotificationSound.swift for that decision.
//
// The relay never sees any of that. It forwards a base64 blob it cannot read
// (crates/slimm-server/src/push/envelope.rs) and sets `mutable-content` so
// this process gets a chance at it; the fixed placeholder exists precisely so
// a device without this extension still shows something.
//
// Every failure path here shows that placeholder instead. A notification is
// worth showing without its content and is worth nothing at all if it never
// arrives, and this process has a hard time budget and a small memory one, so
// nothing here waits on anything, retries, or reaches the network - including
// the sound decision, which reads CXCallObserver's already-known state
// rather than waiting on a delegate callback.
