/// What `MessageExtrasController._set`'s whole-map copy actually costs.
///
/// The 2026-09-13 performance audit flagged it and deliberately did not fix it,
/// because the idiomatic update (`{...state, id: extras}`, which a StateNotifier
/// needs so listeners fire) is O(cache) and the cache is keyed by message id
/// across the whole session rather than per channel. Its instruction was to
/// measure before restructuring, and to close it with the number if the copy is
/// under a millisecond at realistic sizes.
///
/// This is that measurement. What it measures is the map spread itself, written
/// out here rather than driven through `MessageExtrasController._set`, which is
/// private: so it is a number for the operation `_set` performs, not a guard on
/// `_set` continuing to perform it. If the controller ever stops being a flat
/// map copy, this file keeps reporting the spread's cost and will not notice.
/// Read it as "this is what the copy costs", not as a regression bound.
///
/// **It is a dev-box number, which is a lower bound, not the phone measurement
/// the card asked for.** What it can settle is the shape: whether the cost is
/// microseconds, so a 10x device penalty still leaves it invisible, or already
/// milliseconds, so it is real wherever it runs. The assertions are sized with
/// that 10x margin in mind rather than against this machine's own timings.
///
/// ## What it measured, on this box, 2026-09-20
///
/// 100 entries: 9.5us. 1000: 8.1us. 5000: 43.0us. 20000: 648.6us.
///
/// Flat to about a thousand (fixed overhead dominates), then climbing, and
/// sharply so past five thousand.
///
/// ## Why that closes it rather than starting a restructure
///
/// The sizes that matter are the ones the cache can actually reach, and it is
/// bounded twice over: `retention_policy.dart`'s `channelWindowCeiling` caps the
/// store at 1000 rows **per channel**, and `retain()` then keeps only the entries
/// reachable from the channels actually open. So a realistic cache is about 1000
/// times the number of open channels - a few thousand entries - which is 8us to
/// 43us here. Even granting a phone 10x, that is under half a millisecond, or
/// roughly 3% of a 16.7ms frame.
///
/// The 649us figure needs twenty thousand entries, which is an order of magnitude
/// past what the ceiling permits and would need around twenty channels open and
/// fully paginated at once, with the ten-minute sweep never having run.
///
/// So the per-channel partition the audit sketched is not worth its cost: it
/// changes the key shape every consumer reads through, to save tens of
/// microseconds at sizes the retention ceiling already prevents. The number is
/// the answer, and the thing actually holding this up is the ceiling - which is
/// why the 20000 case stays below rather than being deleted. If anybody raises
/// `channelWindowCeiling`, this is where the cost of that shows up.
