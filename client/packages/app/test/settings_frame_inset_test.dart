/// `categories_screen.dart` broke it by coincidence rather than intent -
/// `SettingsScreenScaffold(padding: EdgeInsets.zero)` plus its own
/// `ListView(padding: EdgeInsets.all(AppSpacing.s16))` landed back on the
/// same 16px the frame would have given it for free - and nothing caught it
/// until a review read the file by hand.
///
/// This reads a screen's own source the way `type_scale_literal_test.dart`
/// (design_system) reads for an off-scale `fontSize:` literal: a case this
/// cannot see is a case that was never written the wrong way, so it cannot
/// go stale the way a hand-kept list would.
///
/// Scoped to what a source scan can actually prove cheaply: an explicit
/// `padding:` argument on a `SettingsScreenScaffold(...)` call, and a
/// `Padding` wrapped directly around its `child:` before the frame ever sees
/// it. `SettingsPanesScaffold` takes no `padding` parameter at all - its pane
/// body always pads at `AppSpacing.s16` - so the only way a pane could
/// re-derive its own inset is inside a `SettingsPane.builder` closure, which
/// may be defined anywhere and is not something a scan of the scaffold call
/// site itself can see. That residual is real and is left unenforced rather
