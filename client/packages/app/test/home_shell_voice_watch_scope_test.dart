/// `HomeShell.build` used to `ref.watch(voiceControllerProvider)` whole, at

/// whether a call running in some other channel needs its own strip in the
/// compact layout. `voiceControllerProvider` updates on essentially every
/// room event (active speaker, mute, connection quality), so during a call
/// the entire shell rebuilt on every one of those, when the strip decision
/// only ever turns on the call's connection state or which channel it is in.
///
/// The fix is the same `.select` scoping `ChannelCategorySections` got in
/// `channel_rail_voice_watch_scope_test.dart`: the shell now watches a
/// `(state, channelId)` record, so a Dart record's structural equality holds
/// the rebuild until one of those two changes and drops the participant and
/// speaker churn entirely.
///
/// A behavioural test would have to distinguish "rebuilt" from "rebuilt and
/// happened to render the same pixels", which nothing in `flutter_test`
/// exposes without instrumenting the widgets themselves. This is a scoping
/// property of which slice a `ref.watch` owns, not a rendered outcome, so it
/// is read from source the way that sibling test and `route_reachability_test`
/// already do. The source is scrubbed through `support/code_only.dart` first,
/// so a bare-watch left behind in a comment cannot pass the check: the
/// "must be absent" half is the vulnerable one and is reproduced directly.
