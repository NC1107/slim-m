/// catch the interaction-triggered gap `reduce_motion_gate_test.dart` and
/// today's three fixes closed: nothing here taps anything, so a
/// `showDialog`/`showModalBottomSheet`/`ExpansionTile` never opens.
///
/// The pump is 5ms, not zero and not a settle, and both bounds are load-
/// bearing. Zero elapsed catches `AppMotion.reducedSize`'s own documented
/// 1ms floor mid-flight - an `AnimatedSize` can never reach a literal zero,
/// so channel_rail_frame.dart's own reads as still running at t=0 even
/// though nothing is wrong. A full `pumpAndSettle` goes too far the other
/// way: a bounded animation that ignored reduce motion still finishes and

/// `motionPreferenceControllerProvider` is overridden to `alwaysReduce`
