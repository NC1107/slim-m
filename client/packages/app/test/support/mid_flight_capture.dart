///
/// `ui_snapshot_support.dart`'s own settle budget (two or three fixed
/// pumps) is a guess about how long a surface's async work takes, not a
/// proof that it is finished. The report card overflow shipped invisible
/// because a card's own `initState` fires a *second*, nested resolve that
/// needed one more turn of the event loop than that budget gave it, and
/// until it landed the row showed the short, harmless placeholder
/// `'Loading...'` rather than the real, overflowing name - so every prior
/// capture of that screen was quietly checking a not-yet-loaded state.
///
/// [expectSettled] does not trust the settle budget either: it reads every
/// visible string right where the budget says "done", pumps a further
/// [extraSettlePumps] frames of [extraSettleFrame] each (a timed pump
/// cannot hang the way `pumpAndSettle` does on a perpetual spinner - it
/// advances the clock once and paints one frame, it never loops waiting for
/// quiescence), and reads the same strings again. A real, finished product
/// state cannot change what it says just because time passed; a placeholder
/// still waiting on its own async hop, or content fading in from a ticker
/// that only started on the budget's final frame, can.
///
/// The frames are timed, not bare, because of the second shape this caught
/// shipping invisibly: `AppAsyncView` mounts its resolved content inside an
/// `AppFadeIn`, whose ticker starts when the DATA mounts, not when the
/// screen does. A fetch landing on the settle budget's final frame put the
/// whole admin pane on screen at opacity zero - present in the widget tree,
/// absent from the pixels - and bare pumps advance no time, so the fade
/// never moved and the capture read as stable. [renderedText] therefore
/// also skips text a person cannot see (any ancestor at ~zero opacity):
/// with timed frames, such content transitions invisible-to-visible during
/// the extra pumps and fails as the mid-flight capture it is.
///
/// A settled surface can still be wrong in a way the comparison above can
/// never catch: a stable BLANK. `before == after == []` reads as
/// "identical", so the mid-flight check alone would wave a content-free
/// screen through - a surface that renders nothing settles into agreeing
/// with itself just as cleanly as one that rendered correctly.
/// [expectSettled] additionally fails when the settled read has no visible
/// text at all, unless [allowNoText] says this surface is genuinely
/// text-free (a pure canvas/graphic, say).
///
/// This only catches a surface with truly nothing on screen. A route pushed
/// over `ui_snapshot_support.dart`'s base channel shell (every settings and
/// admin surface) keeps that base shell's own text mounted underneath, so a
/// pane that renders empty while its surrounding chrome still has a title
/// cannot reach an empty [renderedText] this way; only a standalone route
/// can demonstrate this check failing.
