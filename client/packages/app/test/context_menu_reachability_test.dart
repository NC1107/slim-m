///
/// The menu opens on a right-click or a long press. An earlier note in this
/// repository claimed that left it with no semantic action either, so report,
/// block, edit, delete and pin were unreachable to assistive technology. That
/// was wrong, and it was wrong in the direction that matters: `GestureDetector`
/// publishes `SemanticsAction.longPress` for its own `onLongPress`, so VoiceOver
/// and TalkBack have always been able to open it.
///
/// It is worth a test anyway, because that reachability is a side effect of one
/// widget choice rather than anything stated. Swapping `GestureDetector` for a
/// `Listener`, or setting `excludeFromSemantics`, removes it silently, and the
/// only symptom is that a group of people quietly lose every message action.
///
/// The keyboard half was genuinely missing until `ContextMenuFocus`: the row
/// took no focus and no key opened the menu, so edit, delete, pin and report
/// had no keyboard route at all. The first block of tests drives the generic
/// keyboard machinery through report/block, an ungated pair on every message;
/// the tests after that drive the message-only actions (edit) the same way.
