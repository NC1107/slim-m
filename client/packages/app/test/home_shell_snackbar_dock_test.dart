/// The canvas call dock and a plain [showAppSnackbar] both anchor to the
/// same [ScaffoldMessenger] at any layout, because `HomeShell` wraps the
/// rail, the conversation pane and the member pane in one shared [Scaffold]
/// (see `home_shell.dart`'s `showsBothPanes` branch, and its single-pane
/// branch below it). A floating [SnackBar] positions itself against that
/// Scaffold's own bottom edge with no built-in awareness of anything else
/// already anchored there - including the call dock a voice call in an open
/// canvas renders at the same bottom-center spot. Reproduced first (a real
/// snackbar covering the real leave-call button, at two widths: one row and
/// the two-row phone stack), then fixed by `DockHeightReporter` measuring
/// the dock and `app_snackbar.dart` reading that reservation back.
