/// The gap *between* reaction chips, reported as looser than it should read:
/// "emoji reactions can be compacted left to right a bit more, less padding
/// between them."
///
/// Neither a chip's own internal padding nor the `Wrap`'s `spacing` value
/// was ever wrong on its own - both already sat at `AppSpacing.s4`, the
/// smallest step this scale has. The actual culprit is structural: every
/// chip is a `FocusableTapTarget`, which reserves `focusRingGap` +
/// `focusRingWidth` of invisible margin on *every* side for its own focus
/// ring, present whether or not the ring is ever drawn. That margin stacks
/// with the `Wrap`'s own spacing on both sides of every gap, so a single
/// `s4` step painted as three - one chip's margin, the spacing, the next
/// chip's margin. `message_row_parts.dart`'s `_reactionChipSpacing` cancels
/// the one truly redundant piece (the explicit spacing itself), leaving the
/// two chips' own irreducible ring margins as the entire remaining gap.
///
/// It deliberately stops there rather than cancelling a ring margin too:
/// each chip's invisible hit box is opaque to a tap regardless of what is
/// painted under it - `find.byType(AppChip)` reads exactly that box, since
/// `AppChip` returns `FocusableTapTarget` directly with no render object of
/// its own between them - so pulling the boxes into overlapping (a
/// negative spacing) would erase the dead zone that exists today between
/// two chips: every point in the visible gap would then always resolve to
/// reacting on one chip or the other, where today a tap there does
/// nothing. The second test below is what actually proves that dead zone
/// survives, not just that the pills look closer together.
///
/// This measures the true painted pill edges (the innermost `Container` in
/// each chip's subtree, past the invisible hit-target and ring wrappers)
/// with plain `tester.getRect` subtraction, not `support/geometry.dart`'s
/// `edgeGap`: that helper measures a widget's clearance from a *matching*
/// edge of a bounding container, which is the shape a safe-area inset
/// needs, not the shape a facing gap between two side-by-side siblings
/// needs - forcing it here would read backwards at the call site. A
/// fixture with only one reaction would never exercise a gap at all, so
/// this always seeds two.
