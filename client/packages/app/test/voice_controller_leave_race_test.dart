/// no such guard: it read `state` again after awaiting `VoiceSession.leave()`
/// and reset it unconditionally, so a hang-up whose teardown was still in

/// genuinely connected call with no `channelId`, which every voice surface
/// reads as "not in this call" and which the heartbeat needs in order to keep
/// the server's proof of that call alive.
///
/// The gate is on the *session's* `leave`, not on the network, because that is
/// where the real delay is: `room.disconnect()` plus `room.dispose()` is a
/// round trip to the SFU, and nothing in the UI blocks on it - the hang-up
/// button fires and forgets, so the next tap is available immediately.
