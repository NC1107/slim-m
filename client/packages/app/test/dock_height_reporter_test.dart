/// tear down the `ProviderContainer` itself - which a naive deferred write
/// throws into.

/// from under a still-mounted `UncontrolledProviderScope` needs a real
/// app-shaped teardown this file's own narrower harness cannot force.
///
/// The `UncontrolledProviderScope` itself must stay mounted across the
