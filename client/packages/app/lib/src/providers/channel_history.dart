/// Paging a channel's history backwards, and knowing whether the top of it
/// has actually been reached.
///
/// Two things depended on this and neither had it. The transcript rendered
/// `ChannelStartHeader` from the channel's name alone, so a channel with more
/// history than the loaded window announced the start of the conversation
/// while sitting directly above messages nobody had fetched. And scrolling to
/// the top loaded nothing at all: `/sync` and the channel screen's own
/// hydration both stop at 50, and `MessageStore.watchChannel` shows the newest
/// 200 rows, so everything older than that was unreachable in the client.
///
/// [ChannelHistory.atStart] is the answer to both, and it is only ever set by
/// the server running out of older messages - never inferred from a row's
/// `seq`, which soft deletes make gappy, and never from the window being
/// unfilled, which says nothing about what was never asked for.
///
/// [window] is also the whole reason the scrollbar the transcript's
/// `ListView` draws never represents the channel's full history: its extent
/// is the loaded window's, which grows in pages rather than being known up
/// front. Faking a total by estimating unfetched history would answer with a
/// number that changes on every page and cannot be trusted; loading
/// everything up front to make the number real is exactly what paging exists
/// to avoid. The honest reading is a position-within-what-is-loaded
/// indicator, the same trade-off other paginated chat clients make, not a
/// proportion-of-everything gauge - see `message_transcript.dart`'s own note
/// on `_topSlot` for the one place that answer used to lie by omission
/// instead, which is now fixed.
///
/// Do not read that as covering a thumb that jitters, which is a different
/// thing and was a real bug rather than this trade-off showing through. The
/// extent stepping up by a page is one discrete move at the top of the list;
/// the thumb sliding backwards several times a second while somebody scrolls
/// steadily was `ListView`'s own extent estimate re-averaging the handful of
/// rows on screen every frame, and is fixed in
/// `widgets/message_transcript_extent.dart`.
