/// Three constraints shape this, each chosen over an easier alternative:
///
/// - **Once per version, not every launch.** The last version a person was
///   shown something is persisted ([lastSeenWhatsNewVersionKey]), so a
///   relaunch on the same build reads as nothing pending rather than
///   replaying the same sheet. An in-memory "already shown this run" flag
///   was rejected: it would still show the sheet on every cold start, which
///   is not what "once per version" means.
/// - **Never on a fresh install.** [isFreshInstallProvider] is the same fact
///   [restoreSession] already computes for the keychain-wipe check, reused
///   rather than re-derived: a fresh install (or a wipe indistinguishable
///   from one) records the current version as already seen and shows
///   nothing, so a new user's first screen is never a changelog for updates
///   that happened before they existed.
/// - **Never a gate.** [WhatsNewController] only ever decides what to show;
///   nothing reads its state to decide whether the app itself may proceed,
///   and the sheet it feeds is always dismissible.
