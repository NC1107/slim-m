/// twice. One attempt per reconnect, not a loop: a send that fails again (a
/// permission revoked while offline, say) goes back to failed and waits for
/// either a further reconnect or the person to retry it themselves, rather
/// than this hammering the same doomed request. Manual tap-to-retry from a
/// message row's own Retry button calls the identical [retryMessage] and
/// stays the only route for a send that fails again after this.

/// [isCurrent] is checked before every retry, the same guard every other
