/// own `You` section group), and it composed with the composer placeholder
/// so `Message #$personalSpaceName` read as an instruction rather than the

/// accurately; they were outweighed, not wrong. `Notes` names what the row
/// is *for* rather than who it belongs to, which is the more useful fact
/// once a caller has more than a couple of DMs: `You` looks like a person in
/// a list of people, `Notes` reads immediately as the one row that is not a
/// conversation. It also matches the notebook glyph [PersonalSpaceRow]
/// already gives this row - a label finally naming what the icon has been
/// saying - and `Message #Notes` composes at least as well as `Message You`
/// did, describing an action ("jot something down") instead of asking the
/// reader to parse a pronoun. `You`'s alignment with the settings group's
/// own label does not carry over, but that pairing was never load-bearing:
/// the settings group names *your account settings*, this row names *a
/// notes channel*, and losing an accidental echo between two different
/// things does not resurrect the case for the pronoun.
///
/// Purely cosmetic - another member can set this exact string as their own
/// display name, and a DM with them would render the same label.
/// [Channel.isPersonalSpace] (`api.Channel`), not this string, is what the
/// rail matches on; see [channelFromDm]. A caller hunting for this channel by
/// their own real display name rather than this sentinel still finds it:
/// `command_palette_items.dart`'s `channelMatchesQuery` matches a personal
/// space against the caller's own display name too, which is also the one
