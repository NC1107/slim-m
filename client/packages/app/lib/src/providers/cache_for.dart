/// **Bounded by count, deliberately not by a timer.** The obvious shape is

/// but a kept-alive provider does not dispose, so `onDispose` never runs to
/// cancel that timer, and every widget test touching an avatar then fails on
/// Flutter's pending-timer check (which runs before `tearDown`, so no cleanup
/// hook can save it). Sixty-eight tests failed that way before this was
/// rewritten. Counting entries also bounds memory directly, which is the
/// thing actually at risk, where a duration only bounds it indirectly.
