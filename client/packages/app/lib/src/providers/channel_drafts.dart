///
/// It was in-memory only until a restart was shown to be the same event as a
/// switch, from the person's side. On a phone the OS killing a backgrounded app
/// is indistinguishable from a restart to whoever just lost what they typed, and
/// unlike a switch it happens without anyone choosing it. The original scoping
/// call - "the report was about switching channels, never about restarting the
/// app" - was honest about its report and wrong about the loss.
///
/// The write is deliberately fire-and-forget. A draft is worth saving, and it is
/// not worth making a keystroke wait on a disk to find out whether it was: a
/// failed write costs the words a crash would have cost anyway, and blocking the
/// composer would cost every keystroke.
///
/// A reply-in-progress and a staged attachment are deliberately not held
/// here, and that is a decision, not an oversight: `ChannelScreen` already
/// clears the reply target on a channel switch (see its own `didUpdateWidget`
/// doc comment, "a reply is scoped to the conversation it was started in"),
/// and `Composer` now clears a staged attachment the same way. Restoring text
/// while a stale reply or attachment silently rode along pointed at the
/// channel it came from would be worse than restoring nothing.
