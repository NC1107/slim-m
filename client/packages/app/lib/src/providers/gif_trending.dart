/// This used to live as widget state on `_GifPickerBodyState`, which dies

/// Deliberately not `autoDispose`, for exactly the reason above - the same

/// for its own "small, low-stakes, session-length" cache: an `autoDispose`
/// provider is dropped the instant the picker's `ConsumerState` unmounts
/// (which happens as soon as the sheet finishes closing), so it would
/// recreate this exact bug rather than fix it.
///
/// Cached for the whole session rather than on a timer, also matching that
/// precedent: a trending list does go stale over hours, but nothing here is
/// correctness-sensitive the way a message or a permission is, so a session
/// that reopens the picker many times in a row is better served by zero
/// extra round trips than by a periodically-refreshed one. A `keepAlive()`
/// plus a `Timer` was considered and rejected for the same reason
/// `cache_for.dart`'s own doc comment gives: the timer would outlive every
/// test's `tearDown` and fail Flutter's pending-timer check. Restarting the
/// app clears it, the same "good enough" boundary the emoji catalog accepts.
