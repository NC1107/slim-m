/// Account recovery: issuing a member a one-time password reset code.
///
/// The action itself already shipped, on a member's profile popover. Nothing
/// in Space settings mentioned recovery at all, so an administrator looking
/// for it there - which is where an admin action is expected to live - found
/// nothing and concluded the feature was missing. This is a second way in, not
/// a move: [ResetCodeMenuItem] on the popover still works and is still the
/// fastest route when you already have the person in front of you.
///
/// Requires ADMINISTRATOR, matching `POST /admin/users/{id}/reset-code`, which
/// refuses anything less. Issuing a code is a way into somebody else's account, so it
/// asks for more than the MANAGE_SERVER that gates most of Space settings.
///
/// Without the bit the action is absent rather than disabled, which is the
/// rule `space_settings_section.dart`'s own gate states: a member should not
/// be shown a surface and left to answer 403. `removed_members_screen.dart`
/// hides its ADMINISTRATOR-only delete the same way. That state is reachable
/// only by typing the route, since Space settings does not list this pane
/// otherwise, and it still says why it is empty rather than going blank.
