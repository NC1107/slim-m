///
/// Deliberately not built on the drag-and-resize state machine
/// `canvas_ops_controller_select.dart` already drives for a real
/// [CanvasObjectKind] - a presence tile is not one of those (see
/// `canvas_presence_layer.dart`'s own doc for why), so it owns a short,
/// self-contained gesture handler instead, the same shape the self bubble's
/// old screen-anchored drag already used before this file replaced it.
///
/// Being locked, or [tool] not being [CanvasTool.select], wraps only the
/// content in [IgnorePointer]: the resize grip disappears too (nothing to
/// resize while it is not reachable) but the lock control itself never
/// does, or a locked tile would be a dead end with no way back.
///
/// The resize grip and the lock/depth/hide row are hidden - both visually
/// and to hit-testing - until this tile is hovered (desktop) or pressed
/// once (touch, where there is no hover): permanently painting three
/// buttons over every participant's video was report 3 in the backlog
/// channel. The reveal has to live on the outer [Listener] that already
/// wraps this whole tile, not on the controls themselves, because that is
/// the one piece of this widget [locked]'s own [IgnorePointer] never
/// reaches - see this file's own doc above for why the outer `Listener`
/// already has to see every pointer within the tile regardless of lock
/// state. So a locked tile still reveals its own unlock button on a hover
/// or a first press, the same "never a dead end" guarantee [locked] itself
/// already makes.
///
/// The owner reported the same complaint a second time on 0.35.1, after the
/// hover/press reveal above had already shipped, which is what closed the
/// remaining gap: hover and a touch press are not the only ways a person
/// reaches a control. [_focusedWithin] reveals the same row for a keyboard
/// user tabbing onto it, on the owner's own instruction that hover is the
/// desktop-pointer answer and focus has to be the desktop-keyboard one -
/// [IgnorePointer] blocks a pointer tap, never focus traversal, so a hidden
/// button was already Tab-then-Enter reachable, just invisible while it
/// happened, which is worse than either fully hidden or fully shown. A
/// touch press keeps the tap-to-reveal shape it already had (report 3's own
/// fix): a tile is the thing being touched to begin with, so a tap on it
/// costs nothing a drag or a resize was not already going to spend, and the
/// three-second [canvasPresenceTileTouchRevealDuration] window is enough
/// for the follow-up tap on a lock, depth or hide button that a real touch
/// sequence needs. The participant name badge in `canvas_presence_bubble
/// .dart` stays always-on rather than joining this same gate: it identifies
/// whose tile this is for as long as the tile is up, the same job a name
/// label does in every other call surface this app has, where the row of
/// three action buttons and the resize grip are each a thing somebody does
/// once and moves on from.
///
/// [CanvasPresenceManipulableTile.sentToBack] never touches this widget's
/// own layout, gesture handling or paint position at all - see
/// `canvas_presence_layer.dart`'s own doc for why. Only [child] differs
/// (an invisible placeholder when sent to back, the real content
/// otherwise), so the drag area, resize grip and corner controls stay
/// exactly where a person last saw them, whichever side of the drawing
/// surface the tile's own pixels are currently painting on.
///
/// The outer shell (the [MouseRegion] and the [Listener] both) is opaque,
/// replicating a middle-mouse grab-pan and a mouse wheel itself against
/// [document], only while this tile is unlocked with [CanvasTool.select]
/// active - the one state where a pointer here means "manipulate this
/// tile". Any other [tool], or [locked] regardless of [tool], turns both
/// `HitTestBehavior.translucent` and ignores the content: report 2 in the
/// backlog channel, "unable to start drawing on attachments", is exactly a
/// pen stroke that would not start over a camera bubble, and report 4 is a
/// locked, sent-to-back tile still swallowing a click meant for whatever
/// `CanvasSurface` paints above it. Translucent still delivers every raw
/// pointer here, so [_revealForTouch] always runs and a locked tile's own
