/// The one affordance that opens a channel's canvas.
///
/// It sits in a voice channel's header, at every width, rather than only
/// inside a live call: a call needs a configured SFU and somebody already in
/// it, so an in-call-only entry would leave the product's signature feature
/// invisible whenever the room is empty.
///
/// Voice channels and DMs, not text channels, by owner decision. The
/// original call (backlog, 2026-08-13, "there also should not be a canvas
/// in text channels, only voice channels") also read as excluding DMs, since
/// a DM's base permissions granted no `USE_CANVAS` at the time. The owner
/// has since asked for a DM canvas too, to work through something 1-on-1
/// without needing a voice channel for it, which supersedes that reading:
/// `DM_BASE` (`store/dms.rs`) now grants `USE_CANVAS`, and this button opens
/// for a DM the same way it does for a voice channel - the personal space
/// (self-DM) included, where it doubles as a personal scratch canvas rather
/// than needing its own special case. Text channels stay excluded on the
/// original rule: the canvas belongs to talking together or to a direct
/// conversation, not to a channel of many.
///
/// The kind arrives as [isVoice] and [isDm] from the header that builds
/// this, rather than being read back out of the local store: every call
/// site already knows both, and a store round trip would make an affordance
/// appear a frame or two late on a screen that has the answer synchronously.
