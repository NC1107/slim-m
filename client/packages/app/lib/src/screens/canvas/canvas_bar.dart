/// The canvas pane's own minimal identity strip.

/// This used to be the canvas's entire toolbar - five tools, undo, the
/// overflow menu and close, all pinned across the top with the interactive
/// controls pushed to the far corner. The owner reported the flow did not

/// the canvas during a call made the call's own controls disappear outright.
/// Both are fixed by moving every interactive control into `CanvasCallDock`,
/// a floating card near the bottom of the pane - see that file's own doc for
/// the full reasoning. What is left here is purely identity: an icon, a
/// label, and the screen-reader landmark `canvas_pane_semantics_test.dart`
/// already depends on. Nothing here is a button.
///
/// The label used to say only "Canvas", dropped as a side effect of that
/// same pass rather than a considered choice: with several voice channels
/// each carrying their own canvas, alt-tabbing back gave no way to tell
/// which one this was, unlike the voice call header beside it. [channelId]
/// resolves the channel's own name through `channelByIdProvider`, the same
/// row `CallChannelName` reads, so a DM's canvas names its peer the
/// identical way `_DmCallBar` already does.
