/// The one shape for "a setting you turn on or off".
///
/// There were three: `AppListRow(trailing: AppToggle(...))` in
/// `appearance_settings_section.dart`, and a hand-rolled
/// `Padding(Row(Expanded(Text), AppToggle))` in both `voice_settings_screen`
/// and `personal_status_sections`. The hand-rolled pair also reached for a
/// raw `TextStyle(color: tokens.textPrimary)` with no type step, so the label
/// tracked whatever `DefaultTextStyle` happened to be rather than a named one.
///
/// The wrapping label is why this is not simply "use [AppListRow] everywhere",
/// which was the obvious unification and would have lost text. [AppListRow] is
/// deliberately single-line and fixed-height so a rail of channels keeps an
/// even rhythm, and it ellipsizes its label to hold that. Three of these
/// settings carry a whole sentence - "Play a sound when someone joins or
/// leaves a call" - which fits on a desktop pane and does not fit beside a
/// toggle at phone width. Truncating the middle of a sentence describing what
/// a switch does is worse than a row of uneven height, so this one wraps.
///
/// **No row-wide `onTap`**, carried over from `_HighContrastRow`, which is the
/// version of this that was already right: [AppToggle] is its own tap target,
/// so a second one on the row fires both on a single tap, toggling the value
/// and immediately toggling it back.
///
/// Scope is a settings section. A toggle sitting in a *picker* list
/// (`role_assign_sheet`, `member_roles_sheet`) stays an [AppListRow] with a
/// trailing [AppToggle]: there the toggle is one column of a list item whose
/// label is a name and always short, which is a different thing from a
/// setting that has to describe itself.
