/// The per-screen review found the same root cause behind two findings at two
/// scales: "a section with nothing to show renders as literal absence rather
/// than a stated reason for the absence". At screen scale that was
/// [SpaceSettingsSection] returning `SizedBox.shrink()` as an entire screen
/// body, so a caller holding none of its gating bits - reachable not only by
/// a stray URL but by a live permission revocation while the screen is open -
/// watched it collapse to a bare app bar over blank white. At field scale it
/// was a removal with no stated reason rendering no line at all, two lines
/// beside a sibling card's three, which reads as a rendering gap rather than
/// as a deliberate absence.
///
/// This is not a new invention: it is the shape `DebugLogScreen`'s own empty
/// state already had (an icon, a plain sentence, a caption explaining what
/// would put something here), lifted out so the cases that never got that
/// treatment can have it. The list-shaped empty states in this area already
/// read correctly through [AppAsyncView]'s own `emptyMessage`, and this
/// deliberately matches its type step and colour so a screen that has nothing
/// for you reads the same whether the nothing is a list, a screen, or a field.
