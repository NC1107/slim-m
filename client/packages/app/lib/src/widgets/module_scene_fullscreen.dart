/// view: an inline board that won every vertical drag would trap the reader
/// inside it whenever they tried to scroll past.

/// Giving the scene a route of its own resolves it rather than arbitrating
/// it. There is no scrollable here, so every drag belongs to the board, and
/// the board gets the whole window instead of the share
/// [ModuleSceneFrame] rations it inline.
///
/// State is not copied. The same [ModuleSceneRunner] runs here as inline, so
/// for a message-scoped scene every action stores and broadcasts exactly as
/// it would have, and the inline view picks the result up through
/// `messageExtrasProvider` while this is open and after it closes. Opening
/// this is a change of viewport, not a fork of the game.
