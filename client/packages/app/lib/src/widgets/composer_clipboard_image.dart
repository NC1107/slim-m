/// `package:flutter/services.dart`'s own [Clipboard] carries plain text

/// calls `Clipboard.getData(Clipboard.kTextPlain)`, `FlutterPlatformPlugin`'s
/// `getClipboardData:` on iOS reads `pasteboard.string` alone with no image
/// branch, and `FlutterTextInputPlugin`'s `canPerformAction:` deliberately
/// returns `hasStrings` for the system Paste action - "Forbid pasting
/// images, memojis, or other non-string content," in the engine's own
/// comment. So the system Paste item is a dead end on every platform through
/// Flutter's own text-editing path, not merely unimplemented on this one.
///
/// [startClipboardImagePaste]/[stopClipboardImagePaste] are the event-driven
/// half of this seam: a real, working `paste` DOM listener on web, and on
/// iOS a real, prompt-free route of its own - `ClipboardPasteBridge.m`
/// swizzles Flutter's private text input view so the long-press edit menu's
/// Paste item works for an image directly, and hands the bytes to this pair
/// rather than through Dart polling anything. A no-op on Android, Linux,
/// Windows and macOS, so Ctrl+V there keeps its ordinary text-only
/// behaviour rather than silently swallowing a keystroke nothing backs.
///
/// [hasClipboardImage]/[readClipboardImage] are the older poll-and-tap
/// half, real on iOS and Android through a hand-written platform channel
/// (see `composer_clipboard_image_stub.dart`) and a no-op on web and
/// desktop. A composer offers a "Paste image" action rather than a
/// keystroke there, because Android's `ClipboardManager` reaches a Flutter
/// app only when deliberately invoked. It is offered unconditionally on
/// mobile whenever the clipboard holds an image - see
/// `composer_clipboard_paste.dart`'s doc comment for why the swizzle above
/// installing is not evidence it is redundant.
