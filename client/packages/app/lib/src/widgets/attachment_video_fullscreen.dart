/// The route is handed the same `Player`/`VideoController` the inline frame
/// already owns rather than opening a second one: both this route's [Video]
/// and the inline one it was pushed from can render the same live texture at

/// button uses internally), so entering and leaving full screen never
/// restarts playback or re-buffers the clip.
///
/// Modelled on `fullscreen_video_overlay.dart`'s shape (a root-navigator
/// route, a dark `Theme`, a header with a close control, Escape wired
/// through `CallbackShortcuts`) for the same reason that file gives:
/// consistency with the app's one other full-bleed video surface, not a
/// second design.
///
/// Swipe-down-to-dismiss is [SwipeDownToDismiss], the same tracked-drag
/// shape `fullscreen_image_viewer.dart` already uses for a photo (the frame
/// follows the finger via `Transform.translate` and either snaps back or
/// dismisses on release) rather than firing on a binary fling, since a
/// tracked dismissal is what makes the gesture read as native. It is its own
/// widget, not inlined here, so a test can drive it against a plain child
/// rather than a real video texture - see `swipe_down_to_dismiss_test.dart`.
/// It is gated on [AppTouchTargets.of] rather than every pointer kind, per
/// `desktop-vs-mobile.md`'s core rule: a mouse drag on a narrow desktop
/// window is the same situation as a touch drag on a phone, and a pointer
/// user on a wide window already has the close button, Escape, and the
/// bar's own full screen toggle.
