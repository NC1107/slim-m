/// nothing this app controls - the identical gap the motion pass already
/// closed for `showDialog` and `showModalBottomSheet` inside `showAppSheet`
/// (`sheet.dart`). `snackBarAnimationStyle` is the framework's own documented
/// escape hatch for exactly this, the same one `showAppSheet` already reaches
/// for, so a call through here honours `AppMotion.isReduced` rather than only
/// the platform's own reduce-motion switch.
///
/// Fourteen call sites reached `ScaffoldMessenger` directly before this, one
/// of them (`personal_space_menu.dart`) already resolving it through
/// `maybeOf` rather than `.of` for no reason tied to its own behaviour, and
/// none customising duration, an action, or the default
/// `SnackBarBehavior.fixed` - so there was nothing to standardise there
/// beyond routing every one of them through here. A raw
/// [ScaffoldMessengerState.showSnackBar] call anywhere else in this app
/// silently drops the motion override; call [showAppSnackbar] instead, and
/// `reduce_motion_gate_test.dart` fails if a new one appears.
///
/// `HomeShell` puts the rail, the conversation pane and the member pane in
/// one shared `Scaffold` at wide layout, so a floating `SnackBar` triggered
/// from the rail or a popover positions itself against the whole shell's own
/// bottom edge - the same band `canvas_call_dock.dart`'s call controls float
/// in whenever a call is open. Every show here reads
/// `bottomDockReservationProvider` and pads the bottom by that much, so the
/// snackbar clears the dock instead of covering its leave-call button.
///
/// That read only covers a dock already at its final height when the
/// snackbar goes up. `_SnackbarDockGrowth` covers the other direction: a
/// dock that appears, or grows from its one-row shape to its taller
/// two-row one, while an unrelated snackbar shown before it is still on
/// screen. A shrink is left alone on purpose - a smaller or vanished dock
/// only leaves surplus padding under an already-clear snackbar, never a
/// cover, so there is nothing there worth a reshow's visual reset.
