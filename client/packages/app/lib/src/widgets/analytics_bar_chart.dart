/// A hand-rolled bar chart for the analytics screen's three small series.
///
/// No charting package: three simple bar charts do not carry the weight of a
/// new dependency (see `docs/dependencies.md`), and this project already
/// prefers a `CustomPainter` for exactly this kind of small, bespoke drawing
/// (the speaking ring, the status dot). This one widget is reused for all
/// three series - messages by day, active hours, and memory samples - rather
/// than growing a chart type per series.
///
/// Deliberately not the only representation of its data: a chart with no
/// accessible equivalent is a cue carried by one channel alone, which this
/// project's own accessibility stance treats as a failure everywhere else
/// (presence shape, the speaking glyph). [semanticsLabel] carries the full
/// series as text for assistive tech, and the caller is expected to print
/// the headline numbers (a total, a peak) as ordinary visible text alongside
/// the chart - see `analytics_charts.dart` for where that happens.
///
/// The bars alone were unreadable until [ticks] and [maxLabel] existed: a
/// reader could see the shape and answer no question with it - not which
/// hour the tall bar was, not what the scale was. Both are drawn as real
/// [Text] rather than painted glyphs, so they take the reader's own text
/// scaling and theme colours instead of a second set this widget would have
/// to keep in step.
