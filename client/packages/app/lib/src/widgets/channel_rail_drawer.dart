/// animation and the modal semantics all come from [Scaffold] for free, the

/// [ChannelRail]'s own row taps only navigate - they have no idea whether
/// they are docked or inside a drawer that ought to close over the choice.
/// Rather than thread a close callback through every row (three call sites
/// across two files), this widget watches the route's own answer to "which
/// channel is selected" and closes itself the moment that answer changes,
/// which is what selecting a channel here amounts to regardless of how the
/// route got there - a shortcut key cycling channels while this happens to
/// be open closes it exactly the same way a row tap does.
