/// Semantic design tokens for slim-m, exposed as a [ThemeExtension] so a widget
/// does one lookup (`Theme.of(context).extension<AppTokens>()`).
///
/// Shaped by the 2026-07-26 visual identity review (see
/// `docs/decisions/0004-visual-identity-review.md`). Three things it changed
/// that are worth knowing before editing this file:
///
/// - **One accent token could not do two jobs.** A value legible as text and a
///   value recognisable as a fill are different colours, which is why light and
///   dark did not read as the same brand. The roles are split now, and the
///   contrast gate checks honest pairs instead of forcing one value through
///   both.
/// - **On true black the border is the whole elevation system.** Dark mode can
///   lean on fill difference; `#000000` cannot, so the hairline carries it
///   alone and had to be raised.
/// - **The accent is rare on purpose.** Seven roles, listed in the decision
///   record, and that list is closed. The failure mode is not a wrong hue, it
///   is the next contributor adding an accent border to something that looked
///   plain.
///
/// The accent hue is settled: glacier cyan, decided 2026-07-27 (option B in the
/// decision record). It is not the review's stated reason, which a deuteranopia
/// simulation of the real render measured and found wrong; the reason it holds
/// is that teal loses 74% of its chroma under deuteranopia and stops reading as
/// a colour, while cyan keeps effectively all of it. Every value below is
/// derived from two anchors, `#1B6F91` light and `#58B4D8` dark, by preserving
/// the teal family's own OKLCh offsets from its anchor, so this was a hue move
/// rather than a retune. Do not hardcode any of these values in widgets.
