/// The mark's own idea, drawn large: a field of dots on a lattice, and one
/// rounded square that has left it.
///
/// [AppBrandMark] is three dots and a square on a 32 grid. This paints the
/// lattice those dots belong to across a whole panel, faint and neutral, with
/// the accent square resting a half-step off its slot and the slot it left
/// standing empty. It is the brand's one figure at the scale of a page rather
/// than an icon, which is what an onboarding rail can carry that a settings
/// screen cannot. Nothing here is copy, so nothing here can overstate what a
/// server does - the reason the rail below the wordmark was kept blank.
///
/// Neutral-first, as the design language asks: the dots take a hairline
/// token and fade with distance from the square, and the square is the single
/// place brand ink appears. On entrance the square slides from its slot to
/// where it rests, one [AppMotion.slow] ease-out, so the story the mark tells
/// happens once in front of you; under reduce-motion it is simply already
/// there. Geometry is a function of size alone, so a render is repeatable.
