/// - [selected]: a left accent marker plus a soft accent fill, one of the

/// - [unread]: the source lifts both colour (`text-secondary` to
///   `text-primary`) and weight (regular to medium) for `selected || unread`
///   alike, so unread's *distinguishing* cue from selected is the dot, shown
///   only when [trailing] is absent (a trailing count badge already carries
///   the same meaning, so the dot would be redundant next to it).
/// - [muted]: dims the leading and trailing content to `opacity: 0.62`, but
///   deliberately not the label. The source dimmed the whole row, and doing
///   that here dragged an offline member's name below the AA contrast floor
///   (`textSecondary` is already near it); the icon and badge carry the
///   de-emphasis while the name stays readable. Not `textDisabled` either:
///   that means "not actionable", which a muted channel still is.
/// - [touch]: raises the row to [AppSizes.rowTouch]; nothing else about the
///   row changes. Left unset it follows [AppTouchTargets.of].
///
/// Keyboard focus draws a full-row outline in [AppTokens.focusRing]; selection
/// draws a left marker plus a fill in [AppTokens.accentSoft]. The two tokens
