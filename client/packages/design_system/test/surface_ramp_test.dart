/// The surface ramp: whether sunken, base and raised actually read as three

///
/// ## Why OKLab lightness and not WCAG contrast
///
/// `contrast_test.dart` is the right tool for ink on a surface and the wrong
/// one for two adjacent surfaces. WCAG contrast is a ratio of relative
/// luminance, which is close to linear light, so at the dark end a large
/// perceptual step barely moves the ratio and at the light end a small one
/// moves it a lot. Measured on the shipped tokens, dark's sunken-to-base step
/// is 1.038:1 and light's is 1.065:1, which suggests light's is 70% bigger;
/// in OKLab lightness they are 1.77 and 2.15, a 21% difference. Gating the
/// ratio would therefore gate the wrong quantity, so this file uses a
/// perceptual lightness axis and leaves WCAG to the file that needs it.
///
/// ## The invariant
///
/// The three surfaces are a ramp with two steps in it. Neither step may be
/// under half the other. That is a shape claim about the ramp rather than a
/// threshold picked to fit the current hexes: a lower step half the size of
/// the upper one stops reading as a third surface and collapses into base,
/// which is the pane bleeding that `surface.sunken` was added to stop (see
/// `docs/decisions/0004-visual-identity-review.md`, "One more surface").
///
/// Dark failed this before 2026-07-27 at 1.77 against 3.80, a ratio of 0.47,
/// while light has always been even at 2.15 against 2.13. It was one token:
/// `surfaceSunken` moved from `#131518` to `#0F1113`.
///
/// ## Why true black is exempt
///
/// It sets sunken equal to base on purpose, and says so in its own doc: with
/// everything collapsing toward `#000000` the rails stop being surfaces and
/// become regions defined only by their edges, which is why its hairline is
/// the brightest of the three themes. Exempting it by an explicit equality
/// check rather than by omitting it from the map means the day someone gives
/// it a distinct sunken value, it starts being gated.
