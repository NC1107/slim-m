/// WCAG 2.1 relative-luminance contrast, computed from the real design tokens so
/// this file is the token contrast gate rather than a description of one.
///
/// Two things the 2026-07-26 identity review changed here:
///
/// - True black was never tested. The theme map held light and dark only, so the
///   one theme whose contrast is hardest, everything collapsing toward #000000,
///   was the one nothing checked.
/// - Code block colours are gated now. Five roles across three themes is fifteen
///   values, and a fenced block is exactly the surface that quietly ends up the
///   single inaccessible thing in an otherwise AA product.
///
/// Each section below is the full reasoning for one test in [main]; the test
/// bodies carry a two-line pointer back here.
///
/// ## Accent fill
///
/// The pair a split accent exists to make checkable: the fill is brand-true
/// rather than contrast-bound, so what matters is the text on top of it, not the
/// fill against the page behind it.
///
/// ## Danger and warning text
///
/// These carry the messages a user most needs to read and is least able to guess
/// from context: a destructive confirmation, an invite about to lapse. A palette
/// change that quietly dropped one below AA would be least noticeable exactly
/// where it matters most.
///
/// ## Status colours
///
/// Deliberately NOT an AA assertion. A status colour is only ever a small filled
/// shape, never text, and every presence indicator pairs its hue with a distinct
/// shape so the state survives greyscale. Holding these to a text ratio would
/// force four muddy colours that no longer read as traffic lights, and would buy
/// nothing, because nobody reads them.
///
/// What is asserted is only that each dot is visible against the surfaces it is
/// drawn on, and that no two states share a value outright.
///
/// Deliberately NOT asserted: a contrast ratio between two status hues. Contrast
/// ratio measures luminance alone, and the away amber and the dnd red sit at
/// almost exactly the same luminance (1.04:1 between them) while being obviously
/// different colours to anyone with normal colour vision. A first draft of this
/// test gated that pair and "failed" a palette that is fine. Telling the states
/// apart is the shape's job, which is asserted in the AppStatusDot component
/// tests, not here.
///
/// ## Disabled text
///
/// The real invariant, and the only one worth gating: disabled must read as
/// unavailable rather than as merely de-emphasised, so it has to sit below
/// textSecondary. If the two converge, a user cannot tell a control they may not
/// use from one that is simply quiet.
///
/// Its absolute ratio is reported rather than gated, the same way the border is.
/// WCAG 1.4.3 explicitly exempts inactive controls, so any floor here would be a
/// house rule invented in this file, and light mode currently lands at 2.96:1 -
/// close enough to a round number that gating it would be picking a threshold to
/// match the palette rather than the other way round.
///
/// ## Borders
///
/// Borders stay reported rather than asserted, which is a deliberate open
/// question rather than an oversight, and worth writing down rather than leaving
/// as a silent omission.
///
/// WCAG 1.4.11 asks 3:1 of a UI component boundary. Reaching that on #000000
/// needs roughly #5A5A5A, which is not a hairline any more, it is a visible grey
/// rule, and it would undo the border-first look the token exists to serve. The
/// identity review raised true black from #23282D to #2C3238, a real improvement
/// (1.41:1 to 1.62:1) and still nowhere near 3:1.
///
/// So the open question is not the value, it is whether a separator hairline
/// counts as a UI component under 1.4.11 or as an incidental boundary that is
/// exempt. Until that is settled these print, so a regression shows up in CI
/// output and the numbers cannot silently drift.
///
/// ## Canvas cursor hues
///
/// Categorical identity for remote participants. They only work as identity if
/// no two read as the same colour, which is the property worth pinning rather
/// than any particular hex.
