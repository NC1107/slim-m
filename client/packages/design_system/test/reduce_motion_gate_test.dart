/// Found by hand, once each, in `showAppSheet` (`sheet.dart`), the compact
/// branch of `showMemberProfile` (`member_profile.dart`), and the debug
/// log's `ExpansionTile` (`debug_log_screen.dart`); the desktop popover a few
/// lines below the second of those already routed `transitionDuration`
/// straight through `AppMotion.reduced`, which is what `showGeneralDialog`'s
/// own inclusion below is modelled on. This is the sweep those three fixes
/// did not leave behind anywhere else, the same shape
/// `type_scale_literal_test.dart` already keeps for an off-scale font size.
///
/// A per-file occurrence count, not a per-call parse: cheap, and every rule
/// here already holds file-wide today, so a call that carries the override
/// and a sibling call in the same file that does not would pass this gate
/// undetected. That trade is the one `type_scale_literal_test.dart` already
/// made for the same reason - a real parser is a second thing to maintain
/// and drift from the grammar it parses.
///
/// The `ScaffoldMessenger.showSnackBar` rule closes the same gap for a
/// SnackBar, one layer later: `app_snackbar.dart`'s own `showAppSnackbar` is
/// the one place fourteen call sites used to reach `ScaffoldMessenger`
/// directly, each dropping the override on its own. This rule does not by
/// itself force a caller through that one function - a raw call anywhere
/// carrying `snackBarAnimationStyle:` still passes - but it does mean a
/// future call site cannot reintroduce the original bug (no override at
/// all) without either using `showAppSnackbar` or writing the override out
/// by hand and losing the whole point of a shared helper.
///
/// Counts run over `support/code_only.dart`'s comment/string-stripped text,
/// not the raw file: a per-file count comparison is exactly the shape a
/// comment can defeat by inflating one side without touching the other,
/// and reproduced directly - a genuine `showDialog(...)` call with no real
/// override, plus a `// TODO: this should carry animationStyle:
/// AnimationStyle.noAnimation` comment anywhere else in the same file,
/// passed silently before this existed.
