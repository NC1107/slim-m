/// Every listener on the document rebuilds when it fires, and the presence

/// the on-canvas rects before it gets to the part that genuinely depends on
/// where the camera is. A pan or a pinch calls `setCamera` once per pointer
/// event, so a notification that carries no change is a whole rebuild of that
/// for nothing.
///
/// The case that produced it in practice is not a duplicate set but a clamped
/// one: `setCamera` stores `_clamp(next)`, so panning further into a world
/// edge, or pinching past a zoom stop, keeps resolving to the camera already
/// held while the gesture continues. `setViewport` directly above it has
/// always had this guard; `setCamera` did not.
///
/// The pairing matters more than either half. A guard that never notified
/// would pass the first test here and freeze the canvas, so the second half
/// asserts the moves that must still get through, including the one-pixel
/// nudge a coarse guard would swallow.
