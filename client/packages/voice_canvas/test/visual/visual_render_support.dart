/// Rasterising a canvas scene straight to a PNG, with no widget mounted at
/// all: a plain `test()`, a `ui.PictureRecorder`, and a file write.
///
/// This is the technique a previous design pass used to get real pixels out
/// of these painters without going through `testWidgets` at all, since the
/// full canvas pane is known to hang a widget test on a loaded box. Nothing
/// here pumps a frame or touches `WidgetTester`.
///
/// **Every PNG this writes is rasterised in software** (`flutter test` has
/// no GPU), which can paint a thin diagonal stroke as broken or dotted at
/// a low effective pixel width even when the geometry is correct - see
/// `dpi_probe_test.dart`'s own finding on `zoom_stress_0.25x.png` before
/// reading that one as a real gap in the ink.
///
/// ~~The same rasteriser does not blur or alpha-blend a `BoxShadow` either,
/// so a soft translucent shadow paints as flat opaque black with a hard edge
/// in every PNG written here and by the app package's own snapshot tests.~~
/// Wrong about "written here," corrected 2026-08-11 by actually rendering
/// `elevation_note_light.png` and looking: the shadow on the elevated note
/// blurs correctly, a real gradient several dozen pixels wide, not a hard
/// edge. The real cause was never the rasteriser - it is `flutter_test`'s
/// own `AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`, which sets `debugDisableShadows
/// = true` in its constructor for golden-file determinism, and this file's
/// own `main()` never calls `testWidgets`, so that binding is never built
/// and the flag never flips. The app package's own snapshot tests do call
/// `testWidgets`, so that half of the old claim held; see `support/real_
/// shadows.dart` there for the fix, now closing it at the source rather
/// than merely documenting around it.
