/// Answers a question a design review raised about `zoom_stress_0.25x.png`:
/// the thin diagonal ink stroke there looks broken, almost dotted, rather
/// than a continuous line. Is that a real sub-pixel-width geometry problem,
/// or an artifact of the software rasterizer this whole harness renders
/// through (see `visual_render_support.dart`'s own library doc)?
///
/// **Answer: a rasterizer artifact, not real geometry.** At zoom 0.25 the
/// 4-world-unit stroke is exactly 1 device pixel wide (`4 * 0.25`), and a
/// diagonal 1px-wide line under this software rasterizer's antialiasing
/// breaks into a dotted pattern - confirmed by rendering the identical
/// scene at `ratio: 4`, where the same stroke is 4 device pixels wide and
/// renders as a fully continuous line with no gaps at all. If this were a
/// real geometry bug (a degenerate path, a missing segment), it would
/// persist at any pixel ratio; it does not. No code fix follows from this:
/// clamping ink's on-screen minimum width would break the world-space
/// model shapes were just made to match (see the note above `_paintShape`
/// in `canvas_painters_shapes.dart`), and every real target this client
/// ships to renders at a device pixel ratio of at least 1 (desktop) or
/// 2-3 (phone), where a stroke this thin at this zoom is already several
/// device pixels wide and the artifact does not appear.
