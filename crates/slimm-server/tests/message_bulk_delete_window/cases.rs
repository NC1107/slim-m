//! `bulk-delete-by-author`: selecting a raider's messages by author and time
//! window instead of naming ids.
//!
//! The two predicates that matter are the author filter and the window
//! bound, so most cases here exist to prove each one independently: a
//! message from the right author but the wrong time survives, and a message
//! at the right time from the wrong author survives too. Everything else -
//! the audit row, the cap, the permission gate - is the same machinery
//! `message_bulk_delete`'s own suite already covers for the id-list route,
//! reused rather than re-derived; this file only proves the window-select
//! path reaches it correctly.
