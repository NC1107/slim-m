//! a full table scan under the database's one write lock. Left to itself on
//! a database nothing has ever `ANALYZE`d, SQLite can still pick a full scan
//! over an index that exists but is not selective enough to look worth using,
//! the same trap `canvas_index.rs`'s own R-Tree test exists for, so only the
//! plan itself can catch a regression here - the same reasoning that test
