//! The orphaned-attachment sweep, and the custom emoji that sits in front of
//! it.
//!
//! An emoji's image is an `attachments` row nothing ever attached to a
//! message, which is exactly the shape the sweep hunts, and
//! `0016_custom_emoji.sql` guards it with `ON DELETE RESTRICT`. RESTRICT is
//! not a filter: it aborts the whole `DELETE`, so a single emoji stopped the
//! sweep for the entire deployment and no orphan was ever reclaimed again.
//! The sweep has to exclude an emoji's bytes itself.
