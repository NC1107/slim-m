//! `@everyone` and `@here`: two reserved mention words, resolved in
//! `push::recipients::resolved_mentions` rather than through
//! `Store::user_ids_for_usernames`, and only ever expanded once the author
//! holds `Permissions::MENTION_EVERYONE` in the message's own channel.
//!
//! Mirrors the shape `tests/notification_preference.rs` already uses: drive
//! `message_recipients` directly against a real store, each recipient set to
//! `NotificationPreference::Mentions` so a plain message would wake nobody
//! and only a real (or reserved) mention shows up in the result.
//!
//! `MENTION_EVERYONE` is granted through a real, explicitly-created role
//! rather than by making the author an administrator: `ADMINISTRATOR`
//! bypasses the evaluator and would answer `has_permission` truthfully for
//! any bit at all, including one the code never actually checked, which
//! would make these tests pass even if the gate read the wrong constant.
