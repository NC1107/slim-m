//! Gates schema/openapi.yaml against the routes axum actually serves.
//!
//! Both sides are parsed straight out of their source text rather than
//! trusted by inspection, because a schema that only has to be updated by
//! someone remembering to do it always rots: this project has already
//! shipped with the documented surface stuck at a fraction of the real one.
//!
//! The actual scanning lives in `tests/support/openapi.rs`, shared with
//! `tests/openapi_429_coverage.rs`'s "every charging route documents 429"
//! gate, so the router side has exactly one hand-rolled scanner between the
//! two rather than a second brace-counter that can quietly diverge from this
//! one.
//!
//! The crate-level `dead_code` allow covers the shared `support` module: an
//! integration test is its own crate, so every helper this binary does not
//! call (most of `support`'s test-database and SQL-scanning helpers) reads
//! as unused, and this one wants only the schema/router scanners.
