//! What a device that asked for message content in its push actually gets,
//! and - the point of this file - what the relay gets while that happens.
//!
//! The relay is a shared, stateless forwarder: other people's notifications
//! pass through the same process, so "the relay cannot read a notification"
//! is the property that makes sharing one acceptable at all. Content rides
//! *inside* the sealed box, where it is exactly as opaque to the relay as the
//! channel id already was, and these tests assert that against the real
//! serialized `/v1/send` body captured off a real `reqwest` client, not
//! against the wire structs re-serialized against themselves.
//!
//! [`the_relay_never_sees_content_in_any_field_at_any_depth`] is the one to
//! keep working. It searches the whole serialized request body for the
//! message text, the sender's display name and the channel name, rather than
//! naming the fields it expects them to be absent from, so a field added
//! anywhere in the chain - a new debugging aid, a "title" convenience, a
//! future envelope field accidentally hoisted outside the seal - fails this
//! test rather than passing by not being on its list. It is the same
//! technique `message_ops`' `no_op_carries_an_actor_on_any_kind` uses for the
//! same reason.
