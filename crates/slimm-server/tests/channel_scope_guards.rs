//! Two places that acted on a channel scope without fully asserting it.
//!
//! `update_channel` excluded DMs and not threads, so a thread's own channel
//! could be renamed or given a topic - the recurring shape this project has
//! already been caught by twice, where a routine written against the channel
//! kinds that existed keeps running unrevisited once a new kind arrives.
//! `list_channels`, `reorder_channels` and `delete_channel`'s last-channel
//! count all exclude threads already; this was the one that did not.
//!
//! `list_pinned_messages` filtered pins by channel and then joined the message
//! without re-asserting the message belongs to that same channel. Not
//! reachable today, since `pin_message` is the only writer and it checks -
//! which is exactly why it is worth holding structurally, on a read that
//! returns whole message bodies.
//!
//! Its own file rather than added to `threads.rs`, which sits at 496 lines
//! against the 500-line ceiling.
