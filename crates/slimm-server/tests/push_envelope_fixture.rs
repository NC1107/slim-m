//! The shared fixture that keeps the iOS Notification Service Extension's
//! hand-written sealed-box implementation honest.
//!
//! The extension has to open a `crypto_box` sealed box (X25519, HSalsa20,
//! XSalsa20-Poly1305, BLAKE2b) in Swift, and none of those primitives exist in
//! CryptoKit, so `ios/NotificationService/` implements them from their specs.
//! Reasoning about that implementation is not evidence it is right, and this
//! environment has no Swift toolchain and no device to run it on, so the
//! evidence is a fixture instead: real ciphertext produced here, by the same
//! crate version the server actually seals with, opened over there by an
//! XCTest that runs on a macOS runner in `client-ios-ci`.
//!
//! Both sides read one file, the shape
//! `tests/fixtures/mention_charset_cases.json` already established for the
//! mention charset, so a one-sided change fails rather than drifting. It lives
//! under `RunnerTests/` rather than beside its sibling here because an XCTest
//! reads a resource out of its own bundle and cannot walk to the repo root;
//! this side walks to it instead, which is the direction that works.
//!
//! [`the_committed_fixture_is_a_real_sealed_box`] is the one that matters: it
//! proves the committed bytes are genuinely openable by the server's own
//! crate, so a Swift failure against them is a Swift bug rather than a
//! fabricated fixture. Regenerate with:
//!
//! ```text
//! SLIMM_REGENERATE_PUSH_FIXTURE=1 cargo test -p slimm-server \
//!     --test push_envelope_fixture regenerate
//! ```
//!
//! An environment variable rather than `#[ignore]`, matching `SLIMM_GOLDENS`
//! and `SLIMM_UI_SNAPSHOTS`: every run of this rewrites a committed file with
//! different bytes, since a sealed box draws a fresh ephemeral key each time,
//! so an ordinary `cargo test` must not do it by accident.
