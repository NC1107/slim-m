//! Every authenticated route charges a rate-limit class, proven against the
//! router's own source rather than a list kept by hand.
//!
//! `http/extract.rs`'s own doc comment already says why the `AuthedLimited`
//! extractor exists: declaring the class in the signature "makes 'no limit' a
//! visible, reviewable choice instead of an absence". That made an omission
//! reviewable; it never made one impossible, because a handler taking plain
//! `Authed` still compiles and still charges nothing. This project has
//! already paid for that gap once - CLAUDE.md records eight routes charging
//! nothing, found by an audit rather than by CI - and it recurred on the read
//! side, where seventeen authenticated GETs went uncharged, including one
//! serving whole attachment files off disk.
//!
//! So the convention is enforced here instead of trusted. A handler is
//! charged if it either takes an `AuthedLimited<C>` extractor or calls
//! `enforce` itself; anything else fails this test by name.
//!
//! Reads the real source through `support::code_only`, so a comment or a
//! string literal mentioning `enforce` cannot satisfy the gate - the exact
//! defect PR #553 found in eleven other source-reading gates in this repo.
//!
//! The crate-level `dead_code` allow covers the shared `support` module: an
//! integration test is its own crate, so every helper this binary does not
//! call reads as unused, and this one wants only the scrubber.
