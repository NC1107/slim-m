//! `refresh_tokens.session_id` had no index until migration 0042: only
//! `family_id` (0002) and `expires_at` (0019) were ever covered. The
//! revocation `UPDATE` in `revoke_session_rows` filtered on it as a full
//! scan - per session, in a loop, inside `begin_write`'s exclusive
//! transaction - and every `JOIN refresh_tokens r ON r.session_id = s.id`
//! (the push-target reads, one of which runs on every message send once
//! push is configured) made SQLite build a throwaway automatic index per
//! call. This reads both statements out of their own source files, the
//! `canvas_ops/index_plan.rs` technique, so a query edit that dodges the
//! index fails here rather than only slowing down.
