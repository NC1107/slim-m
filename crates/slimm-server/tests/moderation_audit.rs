//! Moderation keeps a record of what was done even after it is undone.
//!
//! `space_removals` and `member_timeouts` hold one row per member and answer
//! only "is this in force now", so lifting either deletes the only evidence
//! that it ever happened - who acted, on whom, and why. `moderation_audit_log`
//! is where the acts accumulate instead.
//!
//! Every case here uses two distinct moderators, one to impose and a different
//! one to lift. An audit trail that records the wrong actor is worse than none,
//! and a fixture where the same person does both cannot tell the two apart.
//!
//! The last two cases assert things that already hold today. They are here
//! because they are the two reads that would break if this table were ever
//! replaced by the `lifted_at` column the debt entry originally proposed: the
//! login gate and the last-administrator guard. Both fail closed in ways that
//! are very hard to undo on a self-hosted deployment - one locks every
//! reinstated member out permanently, the other can leave a Space with no
//! reachable administrator at all.
