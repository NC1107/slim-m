//! What `permissions_in_channels` costs, asserted rather than described.
//!
//! `store/permissions_batch.rs` carried its query cost in a doc comment
//! because this suite had no way to count statements. That comment was wrong
//! once already (see `viewers_among`'s own note on 2026-07-30) and out of date
//! a second time: the function looped a channel fetch per requested id while
//! `may_link` fed it every channel that has ever attached one sha256, on the
//! message-send path.
//!
//! sqlx emits one `sqlx::query` tracing event per statement it runs, so a
//! subscriber counting those events is a statement counter. It has to be the
//! global subscriber, not a thread-local `set_default` one: sqlite is
//! synchronous, so sqlx runs each connection on a worker thread of its own and
//! the event is emitted there. A thread-local counter reads zero and every
//! assertion below then passes vacuously, which is what the first check here
//! guards against.
//!
//! One global counter means one test: this file is deliberately a single
//! sequence rather than three tests that would interleave each other's counts.
