//! The two halves of blocking a client cannot do for itself.
//!
//! Blocking is one viewer's view choice, and hiding a blocked author's messages
//! belongs on the client: keeping them in the local database and filtering at
//! read time is what makes unblocking instant, where dropping them from `/sync`
//! would mean they never arrive again.
//!
//! Two surfaces are out of the client's reach entirely, and both are covered
//! here. A reaction crosses the wire as a count with no reactor ids, by design,
//! so there is nothing for a client-side filter to match on. And a push
//! notification is on the device before any filter runs, which makes it the
//! loudest possible way to be told exactly when the person you blocked spoke.
