//! Everything else in this directory drives an operation to its success
//! status. `verdict::judge` used to treat any non-2xx as a bug in the script
//! and return before the schema was ever consulted, so the entire documented
//! error surface - 401 on 158 operations, 403 on 103, 400 on 87, 404 on 50,
//! 409 on 23 - was validated by nothing. A handler answering a 409 whose body
//! had drifted from `Error` passed every gate this repository has.
//!
//! A representative case per status rather than one per operation. The shape
//! being checked is `Error` itself - that the body is that object, under the
//! status the schema documents, with the content type it documents - and that
//! is the same object on every route, so driving one of each buys the whole
//! surface. What a per-operation sweep would add is the status-to-condition
//! mapping, which is a much larger job and is not what this closes.
//!
//! These calls deliberately do not count toward coverage; see
//! [`crate::world::Contract::refuses`].
