//! The shared "you cannot reach above your own level" comparison.
//!
//! [`members.rs`](super::members) states the reasoning this exists to carry
//! forward: the comparison reads *granted* permissions, never effective ones,
//! so that a subtraction already in force against the target - a timeout, most
//! notably - cannot itself be what makes them look junior enough to be acted
//! on again. Reading effective permissions here would let a caller time
//! somebody out, watch that very timeout strip a bit the target used to hold,
//! and then qualify to act on them a second time on the strength of a state
//! the first action caused.
//!
//! This module is only the comparison. Every consumer's two permission sets
//! come from a different scope (deployment-wide for member moderation,
//! per-channel for a voice kick, a role's own stored bits for role
//! management), so resolving them is each consumer's job, not this one's; a
//! database read here would fix this module to one of those scopes and be
//! wrong for the others. Whether a self-check applies is a per-consumer
//! decision too: it is correct for member moderation (see
//! [`super::members::authorize`]), wrong for a voice kick (kicking yourself
//! is harmless), and meaningless for role management (a role is not a user).
