//! `POST /members/bulk-removal` and `POST /members/bulk-timeout`: one
//! moderation act over several members.
//!
//! Split from `members.rs` rather than grown into it, the same reason
//! `messages_bulk` sits beside `messages`: that file is already carrying two
//! verbs, their undo halves, a listing and the shared guards.
//!
//! **Containment is enforced here, unlike the bulk message delete.** That is
//! not an inconsistency. `escalation_guard` has always guarded member
//! moderation - `members.rs::authorize` runs it on every single-target call -
//! so applying it per target here keeps the bulk verb exactly as strong as
//! doing the same thing one at a time. Decision 0016 removed the guard from
//! bulk message deletion for the opposite reason: the single message delete
//! never had one, so a guard there would have refused in bulk what already
//! succeeded slowly. The rule in both cases is that bulk matches single.
//!
//! Every target is checked before the first row moves. A batch that named one
//! member above the caller's level must not leave the ones before them in the
//! list already removed, which is `canvas_ops_apply`'s validate-all-then-write
//! rule and the reason the store side runs as a single transaction.
