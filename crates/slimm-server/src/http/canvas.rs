//! The Voice Canvas viewport read, backed by the R-Tree migration 0015 keeps
//! in sync.
//!
//! One route serves both the cold fetch and the pan. A client that is panning
//! sends the rectangle it is leaving alongside the one it is entering and gets
//! back only what it does not already hold; a client opening the canvas sends
//! the new rectangle alone. They are the same query with one extra predicate,
//! so they are one route rather than two that would drift apart.
//!
//! It is a pull, not a server-held subscription, and that is deliberate. The
//! client is the only party that knows when it panned, a pull keeps no
//! per-connection spatial state on the server to leak or to rebuild after a
//! reconnect, and a repeated pan is idempotent rather than a stream of
//! corrections. What it does not cover is objects removed while the caller was
//! looking at them: a soft delete does not advance the row's `seq`, so no
//! cursor over `canvas_objects` can observe one. That belongs to the
//! `canvas_ops` stream, which Phase 6 materializes this table from.
