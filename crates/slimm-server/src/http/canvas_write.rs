//! Placing one object on a channel's canvas.
//!
//! A sibling of [`super::canvas`] rather than part of it, so neither file
//! carries both halves of the surface past the review budget.
//!
//! This is the first caller of the direct timeout check `store::timeouts`
//! promised. `TIMEOUT_DENY` deliberately spares `USE_CANVAS`, because that one
//! bit means view *and* draw and subtracting it would blank the canvas rather
//! than make it read-only, so the write path asks about the timeout itself. A
//! timed-out member keeps seeing the canvas and cannot add to it, which is the
//! behaviour the bit cannot express.
//!
//! Three ceilings apply and each bounds a different thing: `MAX_PROPS_BYTES`
//! bounds one object, [`crate::store::MAX_OBJECT_EXTENT`] bounds the area one
//! object claims, and [`crate::store::MAX_OBJECTS_PER_CHANNEL`] bounds the
//! canvas.
//!
//! [`PlaceError::Removed`] exists because `super::canvas_ops_write` gave this
//! surface a removal path: replaying the id of an object a moderator erased
//! is now a distinct 409 from `IdConflict`, since an honest retry racing an
//! erase deserves a truthful answer, not "id taken".
//!
//! What the server does not validate is the inside of `props`, with one
//! exception: an `image` object's `props.attachment` is read, because it is
//! the one field this route needs to authorize - the same `may_link` check a
//! message's attachment already passes through, so pasting bytes onto a
//! canvas can grant no wider a reach than sending them ever could. Every
//! other field, and every field of every other kind, stays opaque the way the
//! read's degrade-to-`{}` already assumes; a schema per kind would make the
//! "kind-specific, opaque" column a lie. The residual is that an object whose
//! points (or, for an image, declared box) run past what it claims paints
//! outside it and vanishes when the box leaves the viewport - a rendering
//! artifact produced by somebody already authorized to draw, not a privilege
//! escape.
//!
//! One thing to know before slice three: a timed-out member cannot mint a
//! LiveKit token at all (`TIMEOUT_DENY` removes `CONNECT`), which is the only
//! reason ephemeral ink over the SFU data channel is not already a way around
//! this - `can_publish_data` is derived from `USE_CANVAS`, which the mask
//! spares.
