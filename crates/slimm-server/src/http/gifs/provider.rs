//! Request dispatch for each supported GIF provider; the actual request and
//! response shape for each lives in its own submodule so this file stays a
//! plain dispatcher.
//!
//! Tenor's shape ([`tenor`]) is pinned against its own published v2 API docs
//! and exercised in tests against a fixture shaped exactly like a real
//! response. Klipy's ([`klipy`]) was originally modeled on public
//! third-party documentation of its API (Klipy's own `docs.klipy.com` blocks
//! automated fetches) and shipped broken: every live Klipy search errored,
//! because the real response nests each format under a quality tier
//! (`file.{hd,md,sm,xs}.{gif,webp,...}`, each an object carrying its own
//! `url`/`width`/`height`/`size`), not the flat `files.{gif,webp}` string map
//! the old code expected. `klipy`'s shape is checked against real captured
//! responses (search, trending, categories, and an invalid-key error) rather
//! than reasoned from documentation.
