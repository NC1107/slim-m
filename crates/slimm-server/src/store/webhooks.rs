//! Incoming webhooks: a user-shaped principal with no session and no roles.
//!
//! See `docs/decisions/0030-incoming-webhooks.md`. Two things depart from
//! `docs/decisions/0028-bot-accounts.md`'s bot shape, and they are the whole
//! of what makes this module different from `bots.rs`:
//!
//! **No session.** [`Store::authenticate_webhook`] returns a
//! [`WebhookContext`], never a [`super::sessions::SessionContext`] - a
//! session is what makes a credential able to *read*, and a webhook must
//! never read. Nothing in this module can produce one, so no `Authed`
//! extractor can ever accept a webhook token; `tests/webhooks.rs` asserts
//! that structurally.
//!
//! **No roles.** [`super::permissions`]'s role loader returns an empty
//! context for any `is_webhook` principal before it even asks which roles
//! that id holds, so a webhook cannot inherit `@everyone`'s grant either, not
//! even by accident. That one guard is what makes "no MENTION_EVERYONE, no
//! ADMINISTRATOR, never counted as an administrator" true everywhere
//! permissions are evaluated, rather than a rule every caller has to
//! remember on its own.
