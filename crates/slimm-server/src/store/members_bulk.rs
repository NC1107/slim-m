//! Removing or timing out several members as one act.
//!
//! The case this exists for is the one MOD2's member search already made
//! findable and gave no way to answer: a wave of throwaway accounts
//! registered through the same invite. Finding thirty of them and then
//! removing them one confirmation at a time is the gap.
//!
//! **Neither verb reimplements the single one.** Both run
//! [`remove_one`] and [`timeout_one`], the bodies lifted out of
//! [`Store::remove_from_space`] and [`Store::set_member_timeout`], so the
//! session teardown, the invite revocation, the replace-not-refuse rule and
//! the audit row are the same code rather than the same intention. This is the
//! rule `messages_bulk` states and the reason it states it: a bulk path that
//! quietly does less than the single one is worse than no bulk path at all.
//!
//! **One transaction for the whole batch**, so a target the caller may not act
//! on cannot leave an earlier one already removed while the request fails.
//! That is `canvas_ops_apply`'s validate-all-then-write rule, and it is why
//! the last-administrator refusal rolls the batch back rather than stopping
//! part-way through it.
//!
//! One audit row per target, never one per batch: the trail answers "what was
//! done to this person", and a single row naming thirty subjects could not.
