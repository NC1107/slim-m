//! Pinned messages: a per-channel highlight set, keyed by (channel, message)
//! exactly like reactions key on (message, user, emoji), so pinning an
//! already-pinned message is naturally idempotent rather than something the
//! caller has to check for.
//!
//! A pinned message's cleanup on delete is not this module's job: it is a

//! soft-delete `UPDATE`, so it runs no matter which code path deletes a
//! message and can never be missed by a future one that forgets pins exist.
