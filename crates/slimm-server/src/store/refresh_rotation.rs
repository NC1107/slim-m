//! Refresh-token rotation, and the reuse detection that guards it.
//!
//! Split out of `sessions.rs` when confirm-before-retire pushed that file past
//! its recorded ceiling. It is a real seam rather than a convenient one:
//! everything left there is about establishing or ending a session, while this
//! is the one loop a signed-in client runs forever, and it is the only part
//! with an adversary in its threat model.
//!
//! Rotation confirms before it retires. Spending a refresh token marks it
//! *pending* rather than finished, and it keeps working until the client proves
//! it received the replacement by using the access token issued beside it. That
//! is what stops a rotation whose response was lost - a dropped connection, or
//! the server restarting mid-request - from signing the client out when it
//! retries with the token it still holds.
//!
//! Reuse detection therefore turns on confirmation rather than on a clock. A
//! replayed token that was already retired means its rotation was confirmed and
//! the honest client holds the replacement, so a second copy presenting it is a
//! leak, and the whole family dies.
