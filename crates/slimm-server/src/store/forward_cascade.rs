//! What happens to the forwarded copies of a message that is going away.
//!
//! A copy is a snapshot of someone else's content, so it goes with the
//! original - but the forwarder's own words do not. A copy with nothing of
//! its own is soft-deleted like any message. One with a note or attachments
//! keeps the message and loses only the snapshot, recorded as an `edit` op so
//! live clients, cold reads and op-stream sync all learn it through paths
//! they already have.
