//! `database_bytes` and `database_reclaimable_bytes` come from SQLite's own

//! never from stat-ing the file or walking a directory: those pragmas are an
//! in-memory header read, while a `stat` can lie about a WAL-mode database
//! (the `-wal` file holds uncommitted pages) and a directory walk over the
//! attachments tree would cost O(files) on every read of this screen.
//! `attachment_bytes` reuses [`super::Store::total_attachment_bytes`], the
//! exact sum `/space/analytics` already reports, so the two views can never
//! disagree about what attachments hold.
