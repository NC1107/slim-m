//! Invites: how someone joins a self-hosted deployment.
//!
//! Registration is open on an unclaimed server so the first account can claim
//! it, but a real deployment wants joining to be by invitation. An invite is a
//! short code with an optional use limit and expiry.
//!
//! A code is spent in one of two places, both through [`spend_invite`] so they
//! cannot drift apart:
//!
//! - [`Store::register_account`], which is how somebody without an account
//!   joins a claimed deployment. The spend happens in the same transaction as
//!   the account insert, so neither half can land without the other.
//! - [`Store::redeem_invite`], for an account that already exists and is
//!   spending a code for the role it grants.
