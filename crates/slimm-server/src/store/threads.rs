//! Threads: a hidden channel opened from one message, per
//! docs/decisions/0005-threads.md's recommendation. A thread is not its own
//! kind of thing - it is an ordinary row in `channels` with
//! `parent_message_id` set, so every other feature (send, edit, keyset
//! pagination, full-text search, bundled sync, push fan-out, the WebSocket
//! fan-out filter) keeps working unchanged, the same leverage modelling a DM
//! as a channel already bought this codebase once.
//!
//! What is different from a DM: a thread's permissions are never evaluated
//! against itself. [`Store::permission_channel`] (`permissions.rs`) resolves
//! them from the channel its parent message lives in, live, on every check -
//! there is no synthesized overwrite and no copy of the parent's bits to go
//! stale.
