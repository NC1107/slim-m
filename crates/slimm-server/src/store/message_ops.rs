//! The message op stream: how an edit or a delete reaches a client that was
//! offline when it happened.
//!
//! `messages.seq` is allocated once, at creation, and never moves again, so a
//! cursor over it can only ever report messages that did not exist last time.
//! An edit changes content in place and a delete sets `deleted_at`, and
//! neither is visible to a `seq > cursor` read at any later point. This is a
//! second, independent sequence over the same channel, dense over the ops it
//! carries, which is what lets a client treat `n + 1` as the very next op that
//! exists rather than as a guess.
//!
//! Density is the whole property, and it holds because every real mutation
//! allocates exactly one seq and writes exactly one row in the same
//! transaction. A mutation that changes nothing writes no row and allocates
//! no seq, which is why [`super::Store::edit_message`] answers three ways
//! rather than two.
