//! Deleting several messages as one act.
//!
//! A raid is the case this exists for: with only [`Store::delete_message`], a
//! moderator spends one request and one confirmation per spam message while it
//! is still arriving.
//!
//! Every side effect of the single delete is reproduced here, because a bulk
//! path that quietly does less than the single one is worse than no bulk path
//! at all. That is the soft delete guarded by `deleted_at IS NULL`, one op per
//! message actually deleted, and the attachment release - plus the triggers
//! 0024 hangs off `messages`, which fire per row whatever shape the statement
//! has, so batching the `UPDATE` loses none of them.
//!
//! **One op per message, never one per batch.** `message_ops` promises exactly
//! one seq per real mutation, and the client leans on it: it applies an op only
//! when its seq is exactly one past its cursor, and reconciles over REST for
//! anything else. A batch that allocated a single seq for N deletions would
//! make every connected client resync - the opposite of what a purge is for.
//!
//! Validation happens over the whole list before any row is touched, the rule
//! `canvas_ops_apply` states for the same reason: an id this caller may not
//! delete must not leave an earlier id in the same request already gone while
//! the request as a whole fails.
