//! Compacting `canvas_ops`: reclaiming `remove`, `clear` and `restore` rows
//! once nothing they did is still in effect, on the same periodic-sweep
//! model as [`Store::sweep_expired_tokens`] and
//! [`Store::sweep_orphaned_attachments`].
//!
//! `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s Phase 6 line asks for retention that "exempts rows
//! tied to open moderation reports" - checked against `store/reports.rs`
//! rather than assumed, and it does not apply: a report never references a
//! canvas object or op at all, so there is nothing there to exempt. The real
//! constraint is undo reachability instead: a `remove` or `clear` must
//! survive for as long as restoring it would still touch something, or
//! deleting it makes that specific deletion permanently un-undoable. That is
//! narrower than "anything it touched is still dead": an object a *later,
//! unrelated* op re-removed is still dead, but restoring the older op would
//! not touch it any more - `apply_restore` fences a `remove`'s own targets on
//! the exact `deleted_at` timestamp that removal set, not on bare deadness
//! (see its own doc), and both sweep passes below check the identical fence
//! for exactly that reason. `place` rows
//! are never touched by any of this - `list_canvas_ops`'s own join reads a
//! placed object straight off the `place` row's own seq, so deleting one
//! would delete the object from every future replay, not the object's
//! history.
//!
//! `restore.target_op` is a plain foreign key onto `canvas_ops.id` with no
//! `ON DELETE` clause, so a `remove` or `clear` cannot be deleted while any
//! `restore` row still names it, however old that removal already is. That
//! is why this runs in two passes: eligible restores first (age alone gates
//! them, since nothing ever points at a restore's own id - `apply_restore`
//! refuses a target that is not itself a `remove` or `clear`), then removes
//! and clears, bounded by age *and* by having no remaining unrestored target
//! *and* no remaining referencing restore. `canvas_op_targets` needs no
//! cleanup of its own: its `(channel_id, seq)` foreign key already cascades.
//!
//! Nothing here changes what a compacted floor means to a reading client:
//! `list_canvas_ops` already recomputes `MIN(seq)` on every read and answers
//! `reset` to a cursor that falls behind it, the same mechanism
//! `message_ops` uses. A swept `remove`/`clear`/`restore` pair nets to no
//! visible change for any replay that crosses it - by construction, since it
//! is only ever swept once every object it named is back in the state it
//! held before that op ran - so a client that pages straight across the gap
//! arrives at the same answer either way.
