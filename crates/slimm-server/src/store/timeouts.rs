//! Member timeouts: a moderator takes away every way of expressing yourself
//! for a while, and takes away nothing else.
//!
//! The enforcement is one subtraction applied where permissions are read, not
//! a check bolted onto each thing a timed-out member must not do. That is the
//! same shape [`super::dms`]'s `BLOCKED_DENY` uses, and it is what makes this
//! reach message send, edits, reactions, attachments, polls, pins and the
//! LiveKit token with no edit to any of those files: they all already ask
//! [`Store::permissions_in_channel`], and the voice token even degrades to
//! listen-only on its own because `VoiceService::mint` derives `can_publish`
//! from [`Permissions::SPEAK`].
//!
//! `until` is compared against the clock at every read rather than swept by a
//! job, so a timeout expires by arithmetic. Nothing has to run on time for a
//! member to get their voice back, which is the property worth having.
