//! `canvas_audit_log`: one row per object a `remove`, `clear` or `restore`
//! actually touched, written in the same transaction as the op itself.
//!
//! This exists because `canvas_ops_sweep` starts deleting old `remove`,
//! `clear` and `restore` rows once nothing they touched is still unrestored -
//! see that module's doc comment for the retention rule - and
//! `http::canvas_ops::CanvasOpDto`'s own doc comment already named an
//! uncompacted op stream as what lets a moderator see who removed what.
//! Compaction breaks that unless the fact is kept somewhere else first, and
//! this table is that somewhere else. `place` is not logged: an object's
//! `author_id` already carries that durably on `canvas_objects`, which is
//! never swept.
