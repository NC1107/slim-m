//! MOD4: the owner-visible moderation-history feed - resolved reports and
//! `moderation_audit_log` rows, merged into one time-ordered, paginated read.
//!
//! The two sources are fetched separately and merged in Rust rather than
//! joined with one `UNION ALL`: a resolved report is filtered per channel the
//! same way [`super::Store::list_open_reports`] filters the open queue (it
//! still carries the reported content snapshot), while an audit row is
//! deployment-wide and carries no channel at all - decision 0011's shape for
//! member moderation. A single query would need to express both `WHERE`
//! clauses at once for no shared benefit.
//!
//! `moderation_audit_log` indexes `(subject_id, created_at)` and
//! `(actor_id)`, neither of which serves a bare `created_at DESC` scan; a
//! full scan of it here is exactly what decision 0015 already accepted at
//! this table's scale ("one row per moderation act on a deployment sized for
//! a friend group is not a growth problem"), so this adds a bounded `LIMIT`
//! rather than a new index and migration.
//!
//! Pagination fetches the top `limit` rows from each source and merges them,
//! which is enough by the standard top-k-per-source argument: any row
//! belonging in the true top `limit` of the merged page can have at most
//! `limit - 1` rows ranked above it in the *whole* merge, so at most that many
//! from its *own* source, which means it is always within that source's own
//! top `limit`. The source matching the cursor's own kind is filtered with
//! the exact `(time, id)` composite [`super::Store::list_open_reports`]
//! already uses; the other source is filtered only on a time ceiling, since
//! two rows can only collide on the exact same instant *and* the same kind
//! when they are the same row - two different kinds sharing one timestamp
//! resolve deterministically by kind and need no id to disambiguate. See
//! [`tie_key`].
