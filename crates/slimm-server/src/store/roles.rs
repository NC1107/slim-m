//! create, on update, and again on every assignment, must never include a bit
//! the caller does not themselves hold, or granting a role becomes a way to
//! hand out access nobody actually approved. What lives here instead is the

//! must always keep at least one administrator, since losing the last one has
//! no recovery path short of direct database surgery. Every mutation that
//! could remove someone's last route to ADMINISTRATOR checks that inside the
