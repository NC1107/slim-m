//! Bulk emoji import: seeding a deployment from a directory of images an
//! operator supplies.
//!
//! slim-m bundles no emoji set and fetches none. This is only the machinery
//! that takes a directory, and everything in that directory is content the
//! operator brought and holds the rights to.
//!
//! Each file is one emoji, named after its filename through the same
//! [`super::normalize_name`] the HTTP upload uses, and stored through the same
//! [`super::add_emoji`], so a bulk-imported emoji is indistinguishable from an
//! uploaded one afterwards. The import is not recursive: a subdirectory is
//! reported rather than descended into, because a nested pack is how two files
//! quietly end up claiming one `:shortcode:`.
