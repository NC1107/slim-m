//! The push envelope: the only thing the relay, and the APNs and FCM
//! infrastructure it forwards through, ever sees.
//!
//! It is sealed with a libsodium-style anonymous sealed box (X25519 plus
//! XSalsa20Poly1305): encrypted to the device's registered public key, with no
//! sender identity of its own, which is the right shape here since the server
//! is not a party the device needs to authenticate, only a courier. Everything
//! outside the sealed box - platform, token, and the coarse `kind` - is
//! routing, and is all the relay is ever handed.
//!
//! **The relay cannot read an envelope, with or without content.** A device
//! that asked for it (see [`crate::store::PushTarget::include_content`]) gets
//! a preview of the message *inside* the sealed box, where it is exactly as
//! opaque to the relay as the channel id already was; every other device gets
//! the same content-free envelope as before, naming nothing but where to
//! catch up from. Sealing is per device, so one device opting in never widens
//! what another device's envelope carries, and no plaintext of either shape
//! ever leaves this function. `tests/push_content_envelope.rs` asserts that
//! structurally against the serialized relay-bound body rather than trusting
//! this paragraph.
//!
//! The preview is bounded twice over, because an envelope too large to send
//! is a notification silently lost rather than a visible error:
//! [`MessagePreview::new`] truncates each field on the way in, and
//! [`seal_for_message`] then measures the real serialized plaintext against
//! [`MAX_ENVELOPE_PLAINTEXT_BYTES`] and falls back to the content-free
//! envelope for that message if it still would not fit. Measuring the encoded
//! bytes rather than trusting the character caps is what makes that safe for
//! any display name or body, however many bytes its characters happen to
//! encode to once JSON-escaped.
//!
//! Every envelope, content-free ones included, also carries `sent_at`: the
//! millisecond this server sealed it. The relay is trusted to forward a
//! payload once, not to forget it, so a payload it retained and replayed
//! later would otherwise let a real preview resurface on a lock screen at an
//! arbitrary later time. The NSE
//! (`ios/NotificationService/PushEnvelope.swift`) is what actually refuses a
//! stale preview - this field only stamps the envelope so it can. `sent_at`
//! is additive: an older client reading a new envelope ignores a field it
//! does not know, and an NSE reading an envelope sealed before this field
//! existed treats absence as "not stale", never as a reason to refuse.
