//! Push notification triggering: turns a new message into (at most) one wake
//! per idle recipient, without ever slowing down or failing the send that
//! triggered it.
//!
//! What that wake carries is [`envelope`]'s subject, and the short version is
//! that the relay can read none of it either way: a device that asked for
//! message content gets a preview sealed to its own key, and every other
//! device gets the same content-free envelope it always did.
//!
//! [`PushSender`] is deliberately a first-class two-state thing rather than an
//! error path. `SLIMM_PUSH_RELAY_URL` and `SLIMM_PUSH_RELAY_KEY` are both
//! optional; a LAN-only or NAT-unreachable self-host has nowhere for a relay
//! to reach it, and that is a fully supported deployment, so an unconfigured
//! sender is a quiet no-op, not a startup failure. When a relay URL is
//! configured, its scheme is checked once here at startup
//! (`crate::sidecar_url::validate`): `http://` leaks every recipient's push
//! token and the relay bearer key in cleartext, so it is refused unless the
//! relay is loopback or private-range, where nothing to leak to ever leaves
//! the LAN.
//!
//! Triggering reads the client-reported lifecycle state, never raw WebSocket
//! presence: iOS suspends a socket without closing it, so a live connection is
//! not proof the app can show anything. A short debounce, keyed per
//! `(channel, recipient)` and evaluated only after lifecycle filtering,
//! collapses a burst of messages to one recipient into one wake instead of one
//! push per message, without one recipient's suppressed window ever silencing
//! a different recipient. A window that turns out to have delivered nobody
//! anything (a relay error, or a stored key too corrupt to seal to) is
//! released rather than left spent, so it collapses a burst instead of
//! dropping the next message's wake outright; see [`Debounce`].
//!
//! [`PushSender::notify_message`] is called synchronously from the message
//! send handler but does no I/O itself: it makes a cheap in-memory decision
//! (is push even enabled?) and, if so, hands everything else, including the
//! debounce, to a detached [`tokio::spawn`]ed task. The message is already
//! committed and its response already on the way back to the caller, so
//! nothing here can turn a successful send into an error, and nothing here can
//! make it slower.
