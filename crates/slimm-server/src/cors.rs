//! Cross-origin access, for a browser build of the client.
//!
//! [`CorsPolicy`] is the same two-state shape as [`crate::push::PushSender`]
//! and [`crate::voice::VoiceService`], except that here the disabled state is
//! the default rather than a fallback. Nothing but a browser enforces the
//! same-origin policy, so a native client sends no `Origin` and is untouched
//! by any of this; the only deployment that needs a policy at all is one
//! serving the web client from a different origin than the API, and that
//! operator can say so.
//!
//! Three decisions here are security decisions rather than convenience ones.
//!
//! - **Unset means no layer at all, not an open one.** A self-host is very
//!   often on a private network that the operator's browser can route to and
//!   the internet cannot. An open policy would hand every page they visit the
//!   ability to drive that deployment from inside the perimeter, which is the
//!   one thing its network position was protecting it from.
//! - **`*` is refused outright**, at startup, rather than accepted as a
//!   shortcut. It is the same exposure as the paragraph above, just written
//!   deliberately, and there is no deployment that needs it: the origins a
//!   web client is served from are a short list the operator knows.
//! - **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is never sent.** This API
//!   authenticates with an `Authorization: Bearer` header that a web client
//!   holds itself and attaches explicitly. Browsers never attach it
//!   automatically, so credentialed mode would buy nothing here while adding
//!   the ambient cookie and TLS-client-certificate authority that makes a
//!   mistaken origin catastrophic rather than merely wrong.
//!
//! A malformed entry fails the process at startup, for the same reason the
//! push relay URL's scheme is checked there: the alternative is an operator
//! discovering it from a browser console, on a path where the failure looks
//! like the server being down.
