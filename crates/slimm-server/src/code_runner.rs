//! The code-runner broker: this server's half of running a fenced code
//! block through a self-hosted Piston instance (`engineer-man/piston`).
//!
//! **slim-m builds no runner of its own and executes nothing itself.** This
//! module speaks Piston's own existing `POST /api/v2/execute` and
//! `GET /api/v2/runtimes` protocol exactly (see [`piston`]) rather than
//! inventing a parallel one - the operator points `SLIMM_CODE_RUNNER_URL` at
//! a Piston instance they run and trust, the same relationship this project
//! already has with the push relay and a self-hosted LiveKit.
//!
//! [`CodeRunner`] is the same first-class two-state shape `push::PushSender`
//! models for the push relay: `SLIMM_CODE_RUNNER_URL` is optional, and
//! absent is the default, fully supported state - a deployment that never
//! sets it behaves exactly as it does today, with no Run affordance on any
//! code block and nothing resembling a startup error.
//!
//! **The server brokers and never executes.** Every call this file makes
//! carries exactly the block that triggered it - a language name and the
//! code - and nothing else: no token, no session, no way for the runner to
//! call back into this deployment. Whatever a compromised or misbehaving
//! runner does, the worst it can produce is a wrong answer in the block that
//! asked for it (see docs/decisions/0007's sharpest-edged constraint).
//!
//! **Ceilings are the server's, not Piston's.** Piston already implements
//! real sandboxing - no network access by default, an unprivileged user and
//! Linux namespaces per submission, CPU/wall-time and memory caps, output
//! truncation, SIGKILL on misbehaviour - and this file does not reimplement
//! any of it. What it adds on top: an explicit `run_timeout`/`compile_timeout`
//! and memory ceiling on every request rather than trusting Piston's own
//! defaults or however an operator's instance happens to be configured
//! ([`piston::execute`]), an outer HTTP client timeout ([`CLIENT_TIMEOUT`])
//! so a runner that never answers at all cannot hang the request that asked
//! for it, and a hard cap on how much of a response this server will ever
//! read ([`piston::MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`]), refusing rather than absorbing
//! anything past it - the same style `http::canvas_write::MAX_PROPS_BYTES`
//! already uses. `Class::CodeRunner` (`crate::ratelimit::class::Class`) is
//! the matching rate-limit ceiling, charged once per actual invocation
//! (`http::module_commands::execute_code_runner`).
//!
//! **Trusting the operator, not the code.** Running arbitrary code from
//! whoever can type in a channel is a real risk regardless of how well
//! Piston sandboxes it; that is why the permission bit this ships with
//! (`Permissions::RUN_CODE`) defaults to nobody and why reaching this at all
//! needs configuration an operator adds deliberately, never something a
//! deployment gets by default. An operator who enables it is trusting the
//! people in their own space, the same trust every other write permission
//! in this project already rests on - and it is worth saying plainly rather
//! than dressing this up as more exotic than it is.
//!
//! **Which languages** a deployment can offer is read from the runner
//! itself ([`CodeRunner::languages`], `GET /api/v2/runtimes`) rather than
//! kept as a list in this codebase, so a client is never offered a Run
//! button for a language nothing has confirmed is actually installed on
//! this specific instance - see PR #1211.
