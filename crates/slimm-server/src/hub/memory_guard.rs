//! Admission control for memory: refuses a new WebSocket connection when the
//! process is close to its cgroup memory ceiling, the same way [`super::Hub`]
//! already refuses one once its own connection ceiling is reached. This only
//! ever gates admission of a *new* connection; nothing here touches one
//! already open.
//!
//! A capacity study found no equivalent protection for memory: holding 1024
//! connections costs about 164 MB, but the process was OOM-killed by the
//! kernel in under a second at a 144 MB cgroup ceiling, after silently
//! accepting 879-976 connections it could not afford. Every send afterwards
//! failed with connection refused and nothing was delivered. This guard
//! closes that gap.
//!
//! ## Discovering the limit
//!
//! Cgroup v2 (`memory.max`, `memory.current`, `memory.stat`, directly under
//! `/sys/fs/cgroup` inside a cgroup namespace - verified on the production
//! host) is tried first, since that is what Docker sets and what the kernel
//! actually enforces. Cgroup v1
//! (`/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes` and friends) is a fallback
//! for older hosts. `SLIMM_MEMORY_LIMIT_BYTES` overrides the discovered limit
//! outright, for a deployment where the cgroup is not visible to this
//! process. If no limit is discoverable by either means, [`MemoryGuard::admit`]
//! always admits: a bare-metal self-host with no configured ceiling behaves
//! exactly as it did before this guard existed.
//!
//! ## Choosing the usage signal
//!
//! `memory.current` includes page cache, most of which the kernel reclaims
//! for free under pressure; comparing it against the limit directly would
//! refuse connections on a server that has simply read a lot of database
//! pages. The readily reclaimable part of that cache is `inactive_file` in
//! `memory.stat`, so this guard uses `memory.current - inactive_file`
//! rather than raw `memory.current`, and deliberately not the narrower
//! `anon` field: a WebSocket connection's steady cost is mostly kernel
//! socket buffer memory, which `memory.current` counts but `anon` does not,
//! so `anon` alone would undercount the exact load this guard exists to
//! police. Active file pages and other kernel memory the kernel does not
//! reclaim on demand both stay counted, which is the conservative direction
//! to be wrong in.
//!
//! ## Choosing the reserve
//!
//! A connection costs about 144 KB, measured linearly from 100 to 1024 open
//! sockets. The runs that got OOM-killed died within a second of the ramp
//! starting, meaning hundreds of connections can be admitted between one
//! memory reading and the next before a guard that only checks "is there
//! room for one more" would even notice - so the reserve has to cover a
//! burst of admissions across a reading's lifetime, not just a single
//! connection. 256 connections' worth (256 * 144 KB ~= 36 MB) plus a margin
//! for ordinary request working memory that is not WebSocket-specific
//! (message bodies, permission cache growth, attachment buffers) rounds up
//! to 64 MiB.
//!
//! ## Caching
//!
//! Reading `memory.current` and `memory.stat` on every connection attempt is
//! correct but wasteful under a connection storm - the exact scenario this
//! guard exists for. Readings are cached for a few hundred milliseconds,
//! bounding staleness to a fraction of a second while capping the read rate
//! to a handful per second regardless of how fast connections arrive.
