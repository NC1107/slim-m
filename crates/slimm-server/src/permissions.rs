//! The deny-by-default permission model and its evaluator.
//!
//! A permission set is a bitmask stored in a 63-bit `INTEGER`. Nothing is
//! granted implicitly: a user can only do what the evaluated set contains.
//!
//! [`evaluate`] resolves the effective set for a user in a channel, in this
//! fixed order:
//!
//! 1. Base. The `@everyone` role's permissions, then the union of every role the
//!    user holds.
//! 2. Administrator bypass. If the base set carries [`Permissions::ADMINISTRATOR`]
//!    the user gets everything and channel overwrites are skipped entirely.
//! 3. The `@everyone` channel overwrite: clear its deny bits, then set its allow.
//! 4. The role channel overwrites, aggregated across the user's roles with deny
//!    winning: set the union of allows, then clear the union of denies.
//! 5. The member channel overwrite, which is absolute and has the final say:
//!    clear its deny bits, then set its allow.
//!
//! Step 4 deviates from the allow-wins convention some platforms use: here a
//! deny on any of the user's roles wins over an allow on another, which is the
//! more conservative reading and matches the project's deny-by-default stance.
//! The member overwrite in step 5 is what re-grants a permission to a specific
//! user despite a role-level deny.
